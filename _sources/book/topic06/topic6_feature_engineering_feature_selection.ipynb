    "In this course, we have already seen several key machine learning algorithms. However, before moving on to the more fancy ones, we’d like to take a small detour and talk about data preparation. The well-known concept of “garbage in — garbage out” applies 100% to any task in machine learning. Any experienced professional can recall numerous times when a simple model trained on high-quality data was proven to be better than a complicated multi-model ensemble built on data that wasn’t clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, I wanted to review three similar but different tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **feature extraction** and **feature engineering**: transformation of raw data into features suitable for modeling;\n",
    "* **feature transformation**: transformation of data to improve the accuracy of the algorithm;\n",
    "* **feature selection**: removing unnecessary features.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article will contain almost no math, but there will be a fair amount of code. Some examples will use the dataset from Renthop company, which is used in the [Two Sigma Connect: Rental Listing Inquiries Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-connect-rental-listing-inquiries). The file `train.json` is also kept [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_lqydkMrmyNAgG4vU4wVmp6-j7tV0XI8) as `renthop_train.json.gz` (so do unpack it first). In this task, you need to predict the popularity of a new rental listing, i.e. classify the listing into three classes: `['low', 'medium' , 'high']`. To evaluate the solutions, we will use the log loss metric (the smaller, the better). Those who do not have a Kaggle account, will have to register; you will also need to accept the rules of the competition in order to download the data."

    "\n",
    "In practice, data rarely comes in the form of ready-to-use matrices. That's why every task begins with feature extraction. Sometimes, it can be enough to read the csv file and convert it into `numpy.array`, but this is a rare exception. Let's look at some of the popular types of data from which features can be extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Texts\n",
    "\n",
    "Text is a type of data that can come in different formats; there are so many text processing methods that cannot fit in a single article. Nevertheless, we will review the most popular ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before working with text, one must tokenize it. Tokenization implies splitting the text into units (hence, tokens). Most simply, tokens are just the words. But splitting by word can lose some of the meaning -- \"Santa Barbara\" is one token, not two, but \"rock'n'roll\" should not be split into two tokens. There are ready-to-use tokenizers that take into account peculiarities of the language, but they make mistakes as well, especially when you work with specific sources of text (newspapers, slang, misspellings, typos).\n",
    "\n",
    "After tokenization, you will normalize the data. For text, this is about stemming and/or lemmatization; these are similar processes used to process different forms of a word. One can read about the difference between them [here](http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/stemming-and-lemmatization-1.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, now that we have turned the document into a sequence of words, we can represent it with vectors. The easiest approach is called Bag of Words: we create a vector with the length of the vocabulary, compute the number of occurrences of each word in the text, and place that number of occurrences in the appropriate position in the vector. The process described looks simpler in code:"

    "Adding onto the Bag of Words idea: words that are rarely found in the corpus (in all the documents of this dataset) but are present in this particular document might be more important. Then it makes sense to increase the weight of more domain-specific words to separate them out from common words. This approach is called TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency), which cannot be written in a few lines, so you should look into the details in references such as [this wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf). The default option is as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "Using these algorithms, it is possible to obtain a working solution for a simple problem, which can serve as a baseline. However, for those who do not like the classics, there are new approaches. The most popular method in the new wave is [Word2Vec](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.4546.pdf), but there are a few alternatives as well ([GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf), [Fasttext](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01759), etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec is a special case of the word embedding algorithms. Using Word2Vec and similar models, we can not only vectorize words in a high-dimensional space (typically a few hundred dimensions) but also compare their semantic similarity. This is a classic example of operations that can be performed on vectorized concepts: king - man + woman = queen.\n",

    "\n",
    "Such models need to be trained on very large datasets in order for the vector coordinates to capture the semantics. A pretrained model for your own tasks can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/3Top/word2vec-api#where-to-get-a-pretrained-models).\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar methods are applied in other areas such as bioinformatics. An unexpected application is [food2vec](https://jaan.io/food2vec-augmented-cooking-machine-intelligence/). You can probably think of a few other fresh ideas; the concept is universal enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Images\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with images is easier and harder at the same time. It is easier because it is possible to just use one of the popular pretrained networks without much thinking but harder because, if you need to dig into the details, you may end up going really deep. Let's start from the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a time when GPUs were weaker and the \"renaissance of neural networks\" had not happened yet, feature generation from images was its own complex field. One had to work at a low level, determining corners, borders of regions, color distributions statistics, and so on. Experienced specialists in computer vision could draw a lot of parallels between older approaches and neural networks; in particular, convolutional layers in today's networks are similar to [Haar cascades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar-like_feature). If you are interested in reading more, here are a couple of links to some interesting libraries: [skimage](http://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.feature.html) and [SimpleCV](http://simplecv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/SimpleCV.Features.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Often for problems associated with images, a convolutional neural network is used. You do not have to come up with the architecture and train a network from scratch. Instead, download a pretrained state-of-the-art network with the weights from public sources. Data scientists often do so-called fine-tuning to adapt these networks to their needs by \"detaching\" the last fully connected layers of the network, adding new layers chosen for a specific task, and then training the network on new data. If your task is to just vectorize the image (for example, to use some non-network classifier), you only need to remove the last layers and use the output from the previous layers:"

    "Geospatial data is often presented in the form of addresses or coordinates of (Latitude, Longitude). Depending on the task, you may need two mutually-inverse operations: geocoding (recovering a point from an address) and reverse geocoding (recovering an address from a point). Both operations are accessible in practice via external APIs from Google Maps or OpenStreetMap. Different geocoders have their own characteristics, and the quality varies from region to region. Fortunately, there are universal libraries like [geopy](https://github.com/geopy/geopy) that act as wrappers for these external services.\n",

Not everyone can or want to tinker with transformations, and these algorithms are robust to unusual distributions.\n",

    "There are also purely engineering reasons: `np.log` is a way of dealing with large numbers that do not fit in `np.float64`. This is an exception rather than a rule; often it's driven by the desire to adapt the dataset to the requirements of the algorithm. Parametric methods usually require the data distribution to be at least symmetric and unimodal, which is not always the case. There may be more stringent requirements; recall [our earlier article about linear models](https://medium.com/open-machine-learning-course/open-machine-learning-course-topic-4-linear-classification-and-regression-44a41b9b5220).\n",
    "\n",

    "You should limit yourself in this process. If there are a limited number of features, it is possible to generate all the possible interactions and then weed out the unnecessary ones using the techniques described in the next section. In addition, not all interactions between features must have a physical meaning; for example, polynomial features (see [sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures.html)) are often used in linear models and are almost impossible to interpret.\n",

    "### Filling in the missing values\n",
    "\n",
    "Not many algorithms can work with missing values, and the real world often provides data with gaps. Fortunately, this is one of the tasks for which one doesn’t need any creativity. Both key python libraries for data analysis provide easy-to-use solutions: [pandas.DataFrame.fillna](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.fillna.html) and [sklearn.preprocessing.Imputer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html#imputation).\n",
    "\n",
    "These solutions do not have any magic happening behind the scenes. Approaches to handling missing values are pretty straightforward:\n",
    "\n",
    "* encode missing values with a separate blank value like `\"n/a\"` (for categorical variables);\n",
    "* use the most probable value of the feature (mean or median for the numerical variables, the most common value for categorical variables);\n",
    "* or, conversely, encode with some extreme value (good for decision-tree models since it allows the model to make a partition between the missing and non-missing values);\n",
    "* for ordered data (e.g. time series), take the adjacent value — next or previous.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Ps-v8F0fBgmnG36S.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy-to-use library solutions sometimes suggest sticking to something like `df = df.fillna(0)` and not sweat the gaps. But this is not the best solution: data preparation takes more time than building models, so thoughtless gap-filling may hide a bug in processing and damage the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would it even be necessary to select features? To some, this idea may seem counterintuitive, but there are at least two important reasons to get rid of unimportant features. The first is clear to every engineer: the more data, the higher the computational complexity. As long as we work with toy datasets, the size of the data is not a problem, but, for real loaded production systems, hundreds of extra features will be quite tangible. The second reason is that some algorithms take noise (non-informative features) as a signal and overfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "The most obvious candidate for removal is a feature whose value remains unchanged, i.e., it contains no information at all. If we build on this thought, it is reasonable to say that features with low variance are worse than those with high variance. So, one can consider cutting features with variance below a certain threshold."
