    "In this course, we have already seen several key machine learning algorithms. However, before moving on to the more fancy ones, we’d like to take a small detour and talk about data preparation. The well-known concept of “garbage in — garbage out” applies 100% to any task in machine learning. Any experienced professional can recall numerous times when a simple model trained on high-quality data was proven to be better than a complicated multi-model ensemble built on data that wasn’t clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, I wanted to review three similar but different tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **feature extraction** and **feature engineering**: transformation of raw data into features suitable for modeling;\n",
    "* **feature transformation**: transformation of data to improve the accuracy of the algorithm;\n",
    "* **feature selection**: removing unnecessary features.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article will contain almost no math, but there will be a fair amount of code. Some examples will use the dataset from Renthop company, which is used in the [Two Sigma Connect: Rental Listing Inquiries Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-connect-rental-listing-inquiries). The file `train.json` is also kept [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_lqydkMrmyNAgG4vU4wVmp6-j7tV0XI8) as `renthop_train.json.gz` (so do unpack it first). In this task, you need to predict the popularity of a new rental listing, i.e. classify the listing into three classes: `['low', 'medium' , 'high']`. To evaluate the solutions, we will use the log loss metric (the smaller, the better). Those who do not have a Kaggle account, will have to register; you will also need to accept the rules of the competition in order to download the data."

    "\n",
    "In practice, data rarely comes in the form of ready-to-use matrices. That's why every task begins with feature extraction. Sometimes, it can be enough to read the csv file and convert it into `numpy.array`, but this is a rare exception. Let's look at some of the popular types of data from which features can be extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Texts\n",
    "\n",
    "Text is a type of data that can come in different formats; there are so many text processing methods that cannot fit in a single article. Nevertheless, we will review the most popular ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before working with text, one must tokenize it. Tokenization implies splitting the text into units (hence, tokens). Most simply, tokens are just the words. But splitting by word can lose some of the meaning -- \"Santa Barbara\" is one token, not two, but \"rock'n'roll\" should not be split into two tokens. There are ready-to-use tokenizers that take into account peculiarities of the language, but they make mistakes as well, especially when you work with specific sources of text (newspapers, slang, misspellings, typos).\n",
    "\n",
    "After tokenization, you will normalize the data. For text, this is about stemming and/or lemmatization; these are similar processes used to process different forms of a word. One can read about the difference between them [here](http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/stemming-and-lemmatization-1.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, now that we have turned the document into a sequence of words, we can represent it with vectors. The easiest approach is called Bag of Words: we create a vector with the length of the vocabulary, compute the number of occurrences of each word in the text, and place that number of occurrences in the appropriate position in the vector. The process described looks simpler in code:"

    "Adding onto the Bag of Words idea: words that are rarely found in the corpus (in all the documents of this dataset) but are present in this particular document might be more important. Then it makes sense to increase the weight of more domain-specific words to separate them out from common words. This approach is called TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency), which cannot be written in a few lines, so you should look into the details in references such as [this wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf). The default option is as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "Using these algorithms, it is possible to obtain a working solution for a simple problem, which can serve as a baseline. However, for those who do not like the classics, there are new approaches. The most popular method in the new wave is [Word2Vec](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.4546.pdf), but there are a few alternatives as well ([GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf), [Fasttext](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01759), etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec is a special case of the word embedding algorithms. Using Word2Vec and similar models, we can not only vectorize words in a high-dimensional space (typically a few hundred dimensions) but also compare their semantic similarity. This is a classic example of operations that can be performed on vectorized concepts: king - man + woman = queen.\n",

    "![image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*K5X4N-MJKt8FGFtrTHwidg.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that this model does not comprehend the meaning of the words but simply tries to position the vectors such that words used in common context are close to each other. If this is not taken into account, a lot of fun examples will come up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such models need to be trained on very large datasets in order for the vector coordinates to capture the semantics. A pretrained model for your own tasks can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/3Top/word2vec-api#where-to-get-a-pretrained-models).\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar methods are applied in other areas such as bioinformatics. An unexpected application is [food2vec](https://jaan.io/food2vec-augmented-cooking-machine-intelligence/). You can probably think of a few other fresh ideas; the concept is universal enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Images\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with images is easier and harder at the same time. It is easier because it is possible to just use one of the popular pretrained networks without much thinking but harder because, if you need to dig into the details, you may end up going really deep. Let's start from the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a time when GPUs were weaker and the \"renaissance of neural networks\" had not happened yet, feature generation from images was its own complex field. One had to work at a low level, determining corners, borders of regions, color distributions statistics, and so on. Experienced specialists in computer vision could draw a lot of parallels between older approaches and neural networks; in particular, convolutional layers in today's networks are similar to [Haar cascades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar-like_feature). If you are interested in reading more, here are a couple of links to some interesting libraries: [skimage](http://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.feature.html) and [SimpleCV](http://simplecv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/SimpleCV.Features.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Often for problems associated with images, a convolutional neural network is used. You do not have to come up with the architecture and train a network from scratch. Instead, download a pretrained state-of-the-art network with the weights from public sources. Data scientists often do so-called fine-tuning to adapt these networks to their needs by \"detaching\" the last fully connected layers of the network, adding new layers chosen for a specific task, and then training the network on new data. If your task is to just vectorize the image (for example, to use some non-network classifier), you only need to remove the last layers and use the output from the previous layers:"

Both operations are accessible in practice via external APIs from Google Maps or OpenStreetMap. Different geocoders have their own characteristics, and the quality varies from region to region. Fortunately, there are universal libraries like [geopy](https://github.com/geopy/geopy) that act as wrappers for these external services.\n",

While traveling along in Manhattan, there can suddenly be a WiFi location from Chicago.\n",

    "> WiFi location tracking is based on the combination of SSID and MAC-addresses, which may correspond to different points e.g. federal provider standardizes the firmware of routers up to MAC-address and places them in different cities.

Here, you can really unleash your imagination and invent features based on your life experience and domain knowledge: the proximity of a point to the subway, the number of stories in the building, the distance to the nearest store, the number of ATMs around, etc. For any task, you can easily come up with dozens of features and extract them from various external sources.

    "Another approach is to use some baseline model for feature evaluation because the model will clearly show the importance of the features. Two types of models are usually used: some “wooden” composition such as [Random Forest](https://medium.com/open-machine-learning-course/open-machine-learning-course-topic-5-ensembles-of-algorithms-and-random-forest-8e05246cbba7) or a linear model with Lasso regularization so that it is prone to nullify weights of weak features. The logic is intuitive: if features are clearly useless in a simple model, there is no need to drag them to a more complex one."

It is possible to iterate until we hit a maximum number of characteristics or until the quality of the model ceases to increase significantly.
