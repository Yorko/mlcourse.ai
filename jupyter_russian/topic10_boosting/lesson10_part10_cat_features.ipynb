    "Пока лес все еще лучше регрессии (хотя мы не тюнили гиперпараметры, но и не будем). Мы хотим идти дальше. Мощной техникой для работы с категориальными признаками будет учет попарных взаимодействий признаков (feature interactions). Построим попарные взаимодействия всех признаков. Вообще тут можно пойти дальше и строить взаимодействия трех и более признаков. Owen Zhang [как-то строил](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgLcfZjNF44) даже 7-way interactions. Чего не сделаешь ради победы на Kaggle! :)"
