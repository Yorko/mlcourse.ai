    "# <center> Topic 6. Feature Engineering and Feature Selection</center>\n",
    "In this course, we have already seen several key machine learning algorithms. However, before moving on to the more fancy ones, we’d like to take a small detour and talk about data preparation. The well-known concept of “garbage in — garbage out” applies 100% to any task in machine learning. Any experienced professional can recall numerous times when a simple model trained on high-quality data was proven to be better than a complicated multi-model ensemble built on data that wasn’t clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, I wanted to review three similar but different tasks:\n",
    "* **feature extraction** and **feature engineering**: transformation of raw data into features suitable for modeling;\n",
    "* **feature transformation**: transformation of data to improve the accuracy of the algorithm;\n",
    "* **feature selection**: removing unnecessary features.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article will contain almost no math, but there will be a fair amount of code. Some examples will use the dataset from Renthop company, which is used in the [Two Sigma Connect: Rental Listing Inquiries Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-connect-rental-listing-inquiries). In this task, you need to predict the popularity of a new rental listing, i.e. classify the listing into three classes: `['low', 'medium' , 'high']`. To evaluate the solutions, we will use the log loss metric (the smaller, the better). Those who do not have a Kaggle account, will have to register; you will also need to accept the rules of the competition in order to download the data."

    "\n",
    "Text is a type of data that can come in different formats; there are so many text processing methods that cannot fit in a single article. Nevertheless, we will review the most popular ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before working with text, one must tokenize it. Tokenization implies splitting the text into units (hence, tokens). Most simply, tokens are just the words. But splitting by word can lose some of the meaning -- \"Santa Barbara\" is one token, not two, but \"rock'n'roll\" should not be split into two tokens. There are ready-to-use tokenizers that take into account peculiarities of the language, but they make mistakes as well, especially when you work with specific sources of text (newspapers, slang, misspellings, typos).\n",
    "\n",
    "After tokenization, you will normalize the data. For text, this is about stemming and/or lemmatization; these are similar processes used to process different forms of a word. One can read about the difference between them [here](http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/stemming-and-lemmatization-1.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, now that we have turned the document into a sequence of words, we can represent it with vectors. The easiest approach is called Bag of Words: we create a vector with the length of the dictionary, compute the number of occurrences of each word in the text, and place that number of occurrences in the appropriate position in the vector.

    "Adding onto the Bag of Words idea: words that are rarely found in the corpus (in all the documents of this dataset) but are present in this particular document might be more important. Then it makes sense to increase the weight of more domain-specific words to separate them out from common words. This approach is called TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency), which cannot be written in a few lines, so you should look into the details in references such as [this wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf).

One had to work at a low level, determining corners, borders of regions, color distributions statistics, and so on. Experienced specialists in computer vision could draw a lot of parallels between older approaches and neural networks; in particular, convolutional layers in today's networks are similar to [Haar cascades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar-like_feature). If you are interested in reading more, here are a couple of links to some interesting libraries: [skimage](http://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.feature.html) and [SimpleCV](http://simplecv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/SimpleCV.Features.html).\n",

Instead, download a pretrained state-of-the-art network with the weights from public sources. Data scientists often do so-called fine-tuning to adapt these networks to their needs by \"detaching\" the last fully connected layers of the network, adding new layers chosen for a specific task, and then training the network on new data. If your task is to just vectorize the image (for example, to use some non-network classifier), you only need to remove the last layers and use the output from the previous layers:"

The first is clear to every engineer: the more data, the higher the computational complexity. As long as we work with toy datasets, the size of the data is not a problem, but, for real loaded production systems, hundreds of extra features will be quite tangible. The second reason is that some algorithms take noise (non-informative features) as a signal and overfit.\n",
