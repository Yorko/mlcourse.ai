Diving into Machine Learning and seeing the math in action is certainly an exciting prospect. However, a significant portion of working on real-world projects, around 70-80%, is actually spent on preparing and cleaning the data. This is where Pandas comes in handy and proves to be a valuable tool, as I use it on a daily basis in my work. This article outlines the essential Pandas methods for preliminary data analysis. We will then analyze a dataset on telecom customer churn and attempt to predict it using common sense alone (and Pandas of course), without any model training. Don't underestimate the power of such an approach.
