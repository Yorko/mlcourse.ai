## Python

Basic fluency in Python programming is a prerequisite for this course, which includes fundamental skills such as writing loops, functions, and classes. It is sufficient to have completed interactive tutorials like DataQuest, DataCamp, or CodeAcademy (no ads intended). However, a more comprehensive understanding of Python is encouraged, as there will be assignments that require implementing machine learning algorithms from scratch.

To gauge your readiness, you can refer to the placeholder provided below, which is part of a [bonus assignment 8](bonus08). If you find it unfamiliar or difficult to comprehend, it is advisable to take an introductory Python course.
