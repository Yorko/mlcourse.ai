The course aims at a perfect balance between theory and practice. Therefore, prerequisites include:

 - [Python](prereq_python)
 - [Math](prereq_math)
 - [Software & DevOps](prereq_software_devops)


## Python

Basic skills are required: writing loops, functions, classes, etc. Passing some interactive tutorials like DataQuest, DataCamp, or even CodeAcademy would suffice (no ads intended). However, a deeper dive into Python is appreciated, there will be some tasks where you have to implement an ML algorithm from scratch.

You can check the placeholder below, it's from [bonus assignment 8](bonus08). If you have no clue what's happenning there, better take an introductory Python course.
