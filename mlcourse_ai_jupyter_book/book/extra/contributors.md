Although led by [Yury Kashnitsky](https://yorko.github.io/), the course is developed by the [OpenDataScience (ods.ai)](https://ods.ai) community. More than 100 community members stepped in helping with editing, proof-reading, translating the materials, assisting course sessions, etc. There're just too many people to acknowledge here (including Patrons), but to name a few contributors, we'd like to thank:

 - [Alexey Natekin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natekin/) for continuos dedicated development of the [OpenDataScience](https://ods.ai) community;
 - [Aleksandr Lozhechnik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksandr-lozhechnik-40021263/) for long-lasting help with the course website;
 - [Egor Polusmak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/egor-polusmak/?originalSubdomain=ru) for a major contribution to translation and proof-reading;
 - [Petr Ermakov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ermakovpetr/) for taking over the Russian version of the course.

 Many thanks for your support, guys! It was great to see your dedication and enthusiasm, just for the sake of doing the right thing, not to earn money.

 _The list will be updated shortly to aknowledge many more contributors._
