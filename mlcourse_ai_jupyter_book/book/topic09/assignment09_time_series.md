**Same assignment as a [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/a9-demo-time-series-analysis) + [solution](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/a9-demo-time-series-analysis-solution).**

**In this assignment, we are using Prophet and ARIMA to analyze the number of views for a Wikipedia [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) on Machine Learning.**

**Fill cells marked with "Your code here" and submit your answers to the questions through the [web form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1UYQ_WYSpsV3VSlZAzhSN_YXmyjV7YlTP8EYMg8M8SoM/edit).**


```{code-cell} ipython3
import os
import warnings

warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import requests
from plotly import __version__
from plotly import graph_objs as go
from plotly.offline import download_plotlyjs, init_notebook_mode, iplot, plot
from IPython.display import display, IFrame

print(__version__)  # need 1.9.0 or greater
init_notebook_mode(connected=True)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
def plotly_df(df, title="", width=800, height=500):
    """Visualize all the dataframe columns as line plots."""
    common_kw = dict(x=df.index, mode="lines")
    data = [go.Scatter(y=df[c], name=c, **common_kw) for c in df.columns]
    layout = dict(title=title)
    fig = dict(data=data, layout=layout)

    # in a Jupyter Notebook, the following should work
    #iplot(fig, show_link=False)

    # in a Jupyter Book, we save a plot offline and then render it with IFrame
    plot_path = f"../../_static/plotly_htmls/{title}.html".replace(" ", "_")
    plot(fig, filename=plot_path, show_link=False, auto_open=False);
    display(IFrame(plot_path, width=width, height=height))
```

## Data preparation


```{code-cell} ipython3
# for Jupyter-book, we copy data from GitHub, locally, to save Internet traffic,
# you can specify the data/ folder from the root of your cloned
# https://github.com/Yorko/mlcourse.ai repo, to save Internet traffic
DATA_PATH = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yorko/mlcourse.ai/main/data/"
```


```{code-cell} ipython3
df = pd.read_csv(DATA_PATH + "wiki_machine_learning.csv", sep=" ")
df = df[df["count"] != 0]
df.head()
```


```{code-cell} ipython3
df.shape
```

## Predicting with FB Prophet
We will train at first 5 months and predict the number of trips for June.


```{code-cell} ipython3
df.date = pd.to_datetime(df.date)
```


```{code-cell} ipython3
plotly_df(df.set_index("date")[["count"]])
```


```{code-cell} ipython3
from prophet import Prophet
```


```{code-cell} ipython3
predictions = 30

df = df[["date", "count"]]
df.columns = ["ds", "y"]
df.tail()
```

**<font color='red'>Question 1:</font>** What is the prediction of the number of views of the wiki page on January 20? Round to the nearest integer.

- 4947
- 3426
- 5229
- 2744


```{code-cell} ipython3
# You code here (read-only in a JupyterBook, pls run jupyter-notebook to edit)
```

Estimate the quality of the prediction with the last 30 points.


```{code-cell} ipython3
# You code here (read-only in a JupyterBook, pls run jupyter-notebook to edit)
```

**<font color='red'>Question 2:</font> What is MAPE equal to?**

- 34.5
- 42.42
- 5.39
- 65.91

```{code-cell} ipython3
# You code here (read-only in a JupyterBook, pls run jupyter-notebook to edit)
```

**<font color='red'>Question 3:</font> What is MAE equal to?**

- 355
- 4007
- 600
- 903

```{code-cell} ipython3
# You code here (read-only in a JupyterBook, pls run jupyter-notebook to edit)
```

## Predicting with ARIMA


```{code-cell} ipython3
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import statsmodels.api as sm
from scipy import stats

plt.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = (15, 10)
```

**<font color='red'>Question 4:</font> Let's verify the stationarity of the series using the Dickey-Fuller test. Is the series stationary? What is the p-value?**

- Series is stationary, p_value = 0.107
- Series is not stationary, p_value = 0.107
- Series is stationary, p_value = 0.001
- Series is not stationary, p_value = 0.001


```{code-cell} ipython3
# You code here (read-only in a JupyterBook, pls run jupyter-notebook to edit)
```

**Next, we turn to the construction of the SARIMAX model (`sm.tsa.statespace.SARIMAX`).<br> <font color='red'>Question 5:</font> What parameters are the best for the model according to the `AIC` criterion?**

- D = 1, d = 0, Q = 0, q = 2, P = 3, p = 1
- D = 2, d = 1, Q = 1, q = 2, P = 3, p = 1
- D = 1, d = 1, Q = 1, q = 2, P = 3, p = 1
- D = 0, d = 0, Q = 0, q = 2, P = 3, p = 1


```{code-cell} ipython3
# You code here (read-only in a JupyterBook, pls run jupyter-notebook to edit)
```
