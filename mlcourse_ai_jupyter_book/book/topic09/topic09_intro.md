<br>

Here we discuss various approaches to working with time series: what types of data preparation is necessary, how to get short-term and long-term predictions. We walk through different time series models, from simple moving average to ARIMA and to general machine learning models with specific feature engineering. We also take a look at the ways to search for anomalies in time series and discuss pros and cons of these methods.
