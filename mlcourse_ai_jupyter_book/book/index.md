[mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai) is an open Machine Learning course by [OpenDataScience (ods.ai)](https://ods.ai/), led by [Yury Kashnitsky (yorko)](https://yorko.github.io/). Having both a Ph.D. degree in applied math and a Kaggle Competitions Master tier, Yury aimed at designing an ML course with a perfect balance between theory and practice. Thus, you go through math formulae in lectures, and practice with Kaggle Inclass competitions. Currently, the course is in a **self-paced mode**. Here we guide you through the self-paced [mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai). Also, in the following [short video](https://youtu.be/0E0DrKvXi-Y) we discuss how to best approach the course material:
