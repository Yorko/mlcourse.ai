**<center>[mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai) – Open Machine Learning Course** </center><br>



[mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai) is an open Machine Learning course by [OpenDataScience (ods.ai)](https://ods.ai/), led by [Yury Kashnitsky (yorko)](https://yorko.github.io/). Having both a Ph.D. degree in applied math and a Kaggle Competitions Master tier, Yury aimed at designing an ML course with a perfect balance between theory and practice. Thus, the course meets you with math formulae in lectures, and a lot of practice in a form of assignments and  Kaggle Inclass competitions. Currently, the course is in a **self-paced mode**. Here we guide you through the self-paced [mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai).

In the following [short video](https://youtu.be/CPlYV_DryEo) we discuss how to best approach the course material:

## How to navigate this website and pass the course

Here you see a [Jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) -- an executable book containing MarkDown, code, images, graphs, etc. (we describe Jupyter books in more detail [later](./prereqs/software_devops.html#jupyter-book)). You can jump forward and backward with left and right arrows. Any page can be downloaded as `.md` (MarkDown) or PDF -- use the Download button in the upper-right corner. Additionally, each page containing code can be downloaded as `.ipynb` -- a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) (not to be confused with Jupyter book). For every page, you can see its source on GitHub, and you can also open an issue or suggest an edit -- use the GitHub button in the upper-right corner.

OK, let's go! First, check [prerequisites](prereq_python), then you see 10 topics -- from exploratory data analysis with Pandas to gradient boosting. For each topic, there's an introductory part ([here's an example](topic01_intro) for Topic 1) that lists articles to read, lectures to watch and assignments to crack.

## Bonus assignments

Additionally, you can purchase a **Bonus Assignments pack** with the best non-demo versions of [mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai/) assignments. Select the ["Bonus Assignments" tier](https://www.patreon.com/ods_mlcourse) on Patreon or a [similar tier](https://boosty.to/ods_mlcourse/purchase/1142055?ssource=DIRECT&share=subscription_link) on Boosty (rus).

  <summary>Details of the deal</summary>

mlcourse.ai is still in self-paced mode but we offer you Bonus Assignments with solutions for a contribution of $17/month. The idea is that you pay for ~1-5 months while studying the course materials, but a single contribution is still fine and opens your access to the bonus pack.

Note: the first payment is charged at the moment of joining the Tier Patreon, and the next payment is charged on the 1st day of the next month, thus it's better to purchase the pack in the 1st half of the month.

mlcourse.ai is never supposed to go fully monetized (it's created in the wonderful open ODS.ai community and will remain open and free) but it'd help to cover some operational costs, and Yury also put in quite some effort into assembling all the best assignments into one pack. Please note that unlike the rest of the course content, Bonus Assignments are copyrighted. Informally, Yury's fine if you share the pack with 2-3 friends but public sharing of the Bonus Assignments pack is prohibited.

The bonus pack contains 10 assignments, in some of them you are challenged to beat a baseline in a Kaggle competition under thorough guidance (["Alice"](bonus04) and ["Medium"](bonus06)) or implement an algorithm from scratch -- efficient stochastic gradient descent [classifier](bonus08) and [gradient boosting](bonus10).

## About the course

If you scroll down here on the left, you see the "About the course" section with additional materials and information:

 - One of the assignments in the past mlcourse.ai sessions was to write a tutorial on almost any ML/DS-related topic. The result is seen on the [Tutorials](tutorials) page;
 - One of the motivating features of the the past mlcourse.ai sessions was the leaderboard. Top 100 participants of each session are listed on the [Rating](rating) page;
 - The [Resources](resources) page lists other resources constituting the course, e.g. YouTube playlists or Medium/Habr.com articles written in the past;
 - Authors and some of the mlcourse.ai contributors (there were too many to list all of them) are listed on the [Contributors](contributors) page. Acknowledgements are there as well.
