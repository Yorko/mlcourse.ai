Small typos in Jupyter notebooks can be fixed with [Pull Requests](https://github.com/Yorko/mlcourse.ai/pulls), followed by a comment, describing the fix (obligatory).

If you think, there is a more serious error in course materials (ex. incorrect math designation), you can open an [Issue](https://github.com/Yorko/mlcourse.ai/issues). 

If you want to proofread course materials and/or develop new ones (ex. assignments), please contact Yury (@yorko) via [ODS](ods.ai) Slack.
