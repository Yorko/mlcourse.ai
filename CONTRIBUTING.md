**Disclaimer**

Keep in mind that the course is in an inactive self-paced mode, the only material that's kept up-to-date is located in the [mlcourse_ai_jupyter_book/book](https://github.com/Yorko/mlcourse.ai/tree/main/mlcourse_ai_jupyter_book/book) folder.

## Issues

Small typos in Jupyter notebooks can be addressed directly from [mlcourse.ai](mlcourse.ai). 

 - click GitHub logo in the top-right corner
 - click "Open Issue", this will bring you to a new GitHub issue called smth like "Issue on page /book/topic01/topic01_pandas_data_analysis.html"
 - add a comment describing the typo/bug/fix (obligatory).

If you think, there is a more serious error in course materials (ex. incorrect math designation), you can open an [Issue](https://github.com/Yorko/mlcourse.ai/issues) right away. 

## Pull requests 

If you are about to open a Pull Request, test `jupyter-book` build on your branch as described [here](https://github.com/Yorko/mlcourse.ai/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#building-course-material-as-a-jupyter-book) in Readme. There are no formal test or CI/CD, but you should be able to see that `jupyter-book` builds and runs with no issues.
