THE SEVENTH SIGN has a great opening hook as the Israeli defence force come across a terrorist base .

However after the great opening third I found the rest of the movie confusing and uninvolving with a large number of plotholes and isn`t all that different from umpteen other supernatural thrillers that I`ve seen
