Some illegal so-called asylum seeker comes to Stuttgart and finds that Germans are "racist." <br /><br />This is just another already-forgotten steaming nugget in a long list of post-WWII anti-German propaganda films, aimed to make Germans feel "bad" for not welcoming each and every degenerate in their country so he can chase German blonds and sell drugs to German teenagers.<br /><br />If you're looking for good German films in General, see "Der Tunnel," "Der Untergang," "Europa Europa," and "Lola rennt."<br /><br />But not this.<br /><br />Also, "Das Experiment," with the same male actor from "Lola rennt."
