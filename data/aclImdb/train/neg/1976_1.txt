How is it possible that a movie this bad can be made. Bad acting. Bad script. Just an embarrassment all around. This is just one bad clich√© after another.<br /><br />This movie actually has some big name stars in it. Unfortunately they're singers and not actors.<br /><br />This movie made hardly any money for a good reason. The appeal of black cowboy movies just isn't there. It's a shame they didn't have a good story to tell. <br /><br />This movie actually has some big name stars in it.
