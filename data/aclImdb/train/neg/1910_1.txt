I've tried to watch this so-called comedy, but it's very hard to bear. This is a bad, narrow-minded, clich√©-ridden movie. Definitively not funny, but very much boring and annoying, indeed. Bad script, bad acting. It's a complete waste of time - and there remains nothing more to say, I'm afraid.<br /><br />1 out of 10 points.
