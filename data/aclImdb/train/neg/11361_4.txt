It is pretty surreal what these flies can do... eh well... this is a cartoon, so anything can happen in it.<br /><br />At first I must tell you that I love animated movies. Unfortunately this year's repertoire is very weak. This cartoon is nothing but a list of flaws:<br /><br />1) I quoted the tag line. It suggests that this movie has great 3D effects. Well, I did not see any, at least not something special I never saw before.<br /><br />2) The "flies" in this movie look nothing like real flies. At least they could've make them black. But cyan flies, seriously? With giant heads and slim torsos?<br /><br />3) The story. I guess it was written for 6 year old kids. I could tell it in two sentences it is so over simplified.<br /><br />4) Excessive patriotism. For example: "They are American files after all!" Oh, give me a break.
