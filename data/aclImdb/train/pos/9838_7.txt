Born Again is a okay episode of Season 1. The reincarnation bit, in my opinion, is cool. The more I watch it, the more I like it, yet it will never rise above 'Very Good' for me. Even though it is not very memorable, i'll always remember it as the reincarnation episode. Anyway, now I will say what is good and bad about this episode,<br /><br />The Good: Oragami. Oh Yeah!<br /><br />That Fish tank was nice. =]<br /><br />Thrown out of a window. Very classy. x]<br /><br />The Bad: Marry your Best Friend's wife!? O_O<br /><br />What a random pick to reincarnate.<br /><br />Why didn't the guy who died by having his scarf tangled up, try to take his scarf off instead?<br /><br />Conclusion: Okay episode, not very memorable. 7/10
