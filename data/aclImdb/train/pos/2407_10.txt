The first time I saw this film, I loved it. It was different.<br /><br />I am a Christian (Bible believing). I don't go along with the crowd of right wing believers. I dropped out of that atmosphere.<br /><br />To me in their attempts to take over our government they are doing what Judas tried to do. I call it the Judas Syndrome.<br /><br />Judas didn't get it, even though Jesus said his Kingdom was not of this world.<br /><br />This film certainly showed some of that.<br /><br />I also liked that Jesus enjoyed the simple pleasure of playing games and jokes with his disciples.<br /><br />Also he was a very gorgeous Jesus.<br /><br />It's a watch-over and over movie.<br /><br />Very satisfying.
