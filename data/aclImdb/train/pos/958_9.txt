Wow! I have seen so many bad low budget films lately, but this one is great. The very realistic portrayal of police life in a city on the East German coast is a strong contrast to other crime movies or series. I loved the main actress and the absolute rejection of any prevalent clich√© about the police. This film is realistic like a documentation and entertaining like a drama at the same time. A perfect tradeoff!
