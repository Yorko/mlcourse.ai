"A little nonsense now and then, is cherished by the wisest men."<br /><br />If you are too smart to watch this movie, then you are too smart to be alive. <br /><br />Wonderful romp, wonderful premise, period piece done with acute eye for detail.<br /><br />Walter Matthau, Meg Ryan, Tim Robbins - et al - just wonderful!<br /><br />Rent it, sit down, relax, take it in, smile a little. Enjoy yourself. <br /><br />Then, thank me.
