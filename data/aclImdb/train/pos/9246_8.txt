One of the great mysteries of life, suffered from daily, is why nice girls so often are more interested in the jerks and heels than in the nice guys.<br /><br />Worse, when the nice guys even want to marry those girls, the girls STILL prefer the jerks and heels, even after the jerks and heels have shown their contempt, have shown they're just interested in using the girls.<br /><br />Stu Erwin is the nice guy, who continues to be nice after being lied to and cheated and even after losing the girl completely.<br /><br />Clark Gable is the jerk, and he is perfect in the role, rather a sad note to his fans.<br /><br />Jean Harlow comes across as a more slender Mae West, even sounding like La West in some of her cynical throwaway lines.<br /><br />Somewhat puzzling is that so many of the other characters, intended to be bad guys -- I mean, heck, they're locked up, so they must be -- are so obviously nice people.<br /><br />In fact, there are lots of nice people here, people who, in a lesser film or story, would be snarling and back-stabbing but here go out of their way to help someone else.<br /><br />So, maybe the story is rather clich√©d, at least by modern standards, but ultimately the viewer will be glad to have watched.<br /><br />The biggest complaint I have is that so many really good actors are not given credit. Once again, we can say a fervent "Thank You" to IMDb.com.
