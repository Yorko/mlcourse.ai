I went to see this movie expecting a nice relaxing time in the theater with my younger sister. Instead, I had to really control myself in order to convince her that I was not scared. In many ways still a childrenÂ´s story, but with a screenplay that has a lot of potential. Could have been one of the scariest movies if planned for another audience.
