I stumbled across rerun syndication of this show several years ago, and fell in love with it. It features TÃ©a Leoni and Holland Taylor and kept me laughing, one episode after the next. I guess it didn't make it so big, and was cancelled after a few seasons, but I believe it was a good run, and would suggest watching it...if the opportunity arises.
