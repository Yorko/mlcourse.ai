Eric Valette is obviously a talented film-maker, and so are the two guys who wrote the script. Therefore Mal√©fique is a great flick, made with just a few bucks but also tons of imagination. Well, I'm a bit exaggerating, but nevertheless I'm sincere. So, if you like dark, gory movies, go and see this one. It's really worth it.
