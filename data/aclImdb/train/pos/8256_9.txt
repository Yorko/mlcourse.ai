Saw this movie at the Vancouver Film Festival and thought it was deadly smart, stylish, and FUNNY.<br /><br />The cast was ROCK SOLID. Great work by Carrie Anne Moss, Dylan Baker, Tim Blake Nelson, Billy Connelly and up and comer, Alexia Fast.<br /><br />Weirdly, I found myself thinking about the movie for days after seeing it.<br /><br />Writers, Dennis Heaton, Robert Chomiak and Andrew Currie layered in a lot of political subtext - but didn't whack you over the head with it.<br /><br />The world they created had depth, and made sense. There is a giddy carnivorous spirit to this movie.<br /><br />FIDO is guaranteed to cure grumpiness.<br /><br />Loved it!!!
