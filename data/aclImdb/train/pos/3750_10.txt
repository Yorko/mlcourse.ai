This is a great short. i think every voice is done by jason steele. (you can only just barely tell if you've heard his normal voice though, so don't worry about them sounding the same. they don't.) its about 15 minutes long.<br /><br />edward the spatula is fighting the war against spoons and he meets some weird people. in fact, everyone he knows seem pretty crazy. <br /><br />"edward!" "general peterson, we have to get you to a medical unit!" "no, I'm not gonna make it edward." "dont talk like that, I'm sure you'll be fine." "im a goner edward, and you know it. before i go-" "yes?" "can i just have... one kiss?" "umm, no." "come on, just one, small, peck on the lips?" "im walking away now sir."<br /><br />there's gonna be movie pretty soon. the date for that is in September, but its probably gonna get pushed back.
