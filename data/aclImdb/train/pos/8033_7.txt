Zane and Beringer will keep you on the edge of your seats. I don't typically go for military/war movies, but this was worth my time.<br /><br />It was serious, but it was also humorous. Beringer's character proved to be heroic and honest. No matter what, you know that he's got your back.<br /><br />Zane's character developed throughout the film. He wasn't just a suit, he definitely proved that he could be a hero and handle a gun.<br /><br />The ending through me a little though. It didn't really go with the action throughout the film, but I'm glad that I saw it, nonetheless.<br /><br />It's worth checking out.
