I had fun watching this movie, mainly due to Simon Pegg, who has quickly become a solid box office draw for comedy films.<br /><br />He is hired from his dead end London publishing job by big shot NYC media mogul Jeff Bridges, as a writer, for one of his celebrity rags.<br /><br />After paying his dues, he makes it into the higher echelons of celebrity writing hackdom (the "seventh room"), where he gets to be a minor celebrity himself. The storyline is very funny, and Gillian Anderson puts in an impressive supporting role as a cutthroat publicity agent.<br /><br />Along the way to success, he finds the true meaning of love, etc.<br /><br />The formulaic plot aside, the movie was very funny, mainly due to Simon Pegg, Jeff Bridges, and Gillian Anderson. Kirsten Dunst was good as the love interest. The rest of the supporting cast did its job well.<br /><br />This was a good comedy & well worth checking out at the theaters.
