Long ago and far away they knew how to make a musical and "Cover Girl" is no exception to the rule.<br /><br />A story of a dancer in a nightclub who becomes a cover girl and famous. The old adage applies here- that happiness and fame always don't mix.<br /><br />The dance routines are marvelously choreographed. What dancing and chemistry between Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly.<br /><br />Otto Kruger is the older gentleman who discovers Hayworth, when he sees her picture that shows a strong resemblance to the woman who left him at the aisle-Hayworth's grandmother Maribel.<br /><br />A jealous reaction by Kelly drives Rusty (Hayworth) into the arms of Broadway producer Lee Bowman.<br /><br />The picture is basically history repeating itself at the end.<br /><br />To add to the glory of this fine film, there is the always wise-cracking Eve Arden and the hilarious Phil Silvers, appropriately named Genius in the film.
