Well every scene so perfectly presented. Never before had I seen such a movie that has meaning in almost every scene.<br /><br />Well while I was watching this movie I remembered watching "Amilie". Amilie is also a similar kind of movie with more fun and fantasy touch. These movies are both based on a same plot line. But both of them are Perfectly perfect in there own way and being able to create a world of their own.<br /><br />Red is able to provoke lots of thoughts in people about destiny and dejavu s. And I am still thinking about it.<br /><br />The story is great and the ending is a bit funny. I was laughing in the end scene. Well funny how this three movie Red White and Blue are connected.<br /><br />All in all a great work of art. A work of a masterman.<br /><br />10/10
