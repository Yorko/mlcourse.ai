Okay, I think we're all agreed that Michael Jackson was the low point.<br /><br />And the special effects too. But, please, keep in mind that this was NOT a big-budget film, okay? Not every film gets as much of a budget as Harry Potter or Star Wars.<br /><br />However, I thought it was pretty funny altogether. B-? Nothing that would, in my opinion, waste your time.<br /><br />Parodies are always fun to watch, and just because it wasn't big budget doesn't mean it's bad.<br /><br />I think this was a good movie, if weak at some points.<br /><br />Hope this comment helps. ~Angela
