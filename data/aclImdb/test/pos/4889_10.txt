I am an addict of the TV show, the live shows and everything they do. And this was the last piece of work they have done on TV/film as 'The League of Gentlemen'.<br /><br />If you love the series then you will absolutely love the film. It is a nice ending to their TV series. <br /><br />It is clever and funny.<br /><br />Although it does not focus on some of the most popular characters, it is still great to see all the characters together and with the writers. A must see for any League of Gentlemen fan.<br /><br />Watch it!
