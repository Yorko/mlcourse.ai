With the exception of the main character, the acting didn't convince me, but the story was quite good: It's about a love affair between a gay party boy and a young Mormon missionary. As you can imagine, such a relationship is quite problematic. The movie is very American and, as such, has some metaphysical undertones to counterbalance its criticism of religious intolerance. But some story lines are hilarious: one of the main characters asks his gay colleague: "Do you believe in God?" And he answers: "Â…you mean: other than Madonna?" All in all, the film is not one of my all-time favorites, but the script is really good and I really liked it: it's entertaining and stands up against (religious) prejudice and intolerance. I think this is an important message in our times. Since I rated films that I liked less with 9, this is clearly a 10 for me. Some people may find this exaggerated, but I think this film deserves it.
