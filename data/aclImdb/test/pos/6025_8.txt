The plot starts out interesting, however, towards the end too many die in too short a time, turning the thriller-mystery aspect of the story into a slaughter.<br /><br />The only true highlights were Adam Beach and JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, who were once again their excellent selves. Nice try with an inappropriate last third, though a good ending.
