The Pickle was the most underrated film of the decade. Despite my best efforts at home, it is still seen as a bad movie. I say to hell with everyone on this. Every one doesn't understand that it is in part a comedy with a dramatic twist at the end. Danny Aiello plays a burnt out director with perfection and conveys a sad depressed man. the scene when he is trying to record a last message is quite good. The interludes of Stones movie are absolutely funny. "This is Harry Stone and today I become a man!" In all a fine and sadly misunderstood movie. Plus a great cameo by Little Richard. Hilarious! I hope that more people see this movie because 202 people is not enough for a consensus.<br /><br />-Silence Dogood
