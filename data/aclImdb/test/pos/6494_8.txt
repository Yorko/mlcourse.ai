Thank goodness not all Dutch people are that ruthless. I think Jason is being judged like that by most people, simply because he has a famous father. Maybe he's not as great as some of those actors, but he's definitely not as bad as suggested. <br /><br />I watched the movie some years ago, and I actually loved it. I knew Jason from other movies and of course Robin of Sherwood. But I must say I really liked his acting from this movie on. It was really good!<br /><br />During the movie, I actually forgot he was the son of. Sean.. who?<br /><br />And if you're a Shakespeare lover, I can recommend this movie. I'm sure you'll enjoy it!
