well-made documentary about a sailing race, sanity and the loss of both.<br /><br />i remembered reading Sir Francis Chichester's account of his trip around the world when i was in high school as i watched this film. what an adventure that was. <br /><br />deep water tells an equally fascinating story. <br /><br />it takes a special person and an excellent sailor to manage a non-stop trip around the world...alone.<br /><br />this film does a great job of demonstrating that.<br /><br />i love to sail, and my brother races J-30s.<br /><br />but i could never accomplish such a feat.
