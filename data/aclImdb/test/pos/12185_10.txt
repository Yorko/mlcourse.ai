okay... first to Anne rice BOOK fans....<br /><br />sure lestat's eyes are not blue...sure he isn't blond in this movie... but even though Marius is not lestat's maker...even though they COMPLETELY altered the story.....<br /><br />how can u say its not a good movie..<br /><br />this movie...is the BEST vampire movie i ever saw...and lestat is pictured perfectly in it....maybe not his features...but i don't think one can find a better lestat....the way he speaks...and the way he looks at mere mortals...his arrogance..and sheer love for fame is pictured flawlessly.<br /><br />if u for once...consider it just a movie..and not try and relate every scene to the book...u will love the movie as much as i do.<br /><br />now...to the non readers..<br /><br />be prepared to fall absolutely in love with this movie....it has every thing....and the goth music...is like an added treat... the dialogues...are beautiful...and catching...and even though its a vampire movie..u will find yourself smiling...at the wit of the characters...and u will find yourself sympathizing with the vampires..<br /><br />overall...one of my fav movies...!!10/10
