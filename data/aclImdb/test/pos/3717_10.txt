Remember that this came out before Gulf War I, which gave us Werner Herzog's "Lessons of Darkness".<br /><br />Le Dernier Combat is not "Sci Fi". It's more like Judgment. I've watched it at least a dozen times. It really is a fitting companion to Herzog's "Lessons of Darkness": "And in that time, men will seek death, but they will not find it, for death will flee from them."<br /><br />That someday, alas, may be today, in Iraq. <br /><br />But, back to Le Dernier Combat, make sure to watch thru the very last second of the film. I wouldn't call it a "surprise ending", but it is something you'll miss if you just assume the end won't be anything more than what you will already have seen.
