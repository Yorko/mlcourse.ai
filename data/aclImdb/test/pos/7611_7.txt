Josie is a reporter from a newspaper is set a task to go back to high school as she is going to be 17 again. .<br /><br />As she is there, she remembers some really awful stuff thats happened to her the first time she was in Highschool as we see in flashback scenes.<br /><br />In the flashback they show that (little spoiler) Josie was kind of a nerd in high school and was picked on a lot and one day the cool guy tells her that he is taking her to the prom, only on the prom night as she leaves her house she gets egged by the ass hole and his bitch. what a horrible thing to do (some will find this hard to watch as it so nasty and it will make you feel warmer to Josie).<br /><br />I did not find this movie that funny but there was some really funny stuff in the office scenes a lot more funnier then anything that happened in the school.<br /><br />This movie did have the perfect happy ending, as it did bring tears to my mum and sister eyes. The acting in this movie was not outstanding, it was good for the most part of the movie, there is some poor acting in some parts of the movie.<br /><br />I going to give this movie 7 out 10.
