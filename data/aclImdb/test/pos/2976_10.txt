I saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it. What a movie. I am in my 40s now and have 2 teenage kids and I would like them to see this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a romance movie or older Elton John music.<br /><br />I have searched most of the stores that sell both new and old movies but have not come across any.<br /><br />I bought some old movies like " Melody" in Hong Kong, who had quite a collection of old movie, but they did not have this. <br /><br />I am also looking at the sequel, Paul & Michelle.<br /><br />Can anyone please tell me how to get a copy of the VHS or DVD or VCD.<br /><br />Really appreciate it.<br /><br />Many Thanks.
