The first season told pretty much how all elements of the Marine Corps would operate (i.e. ground, air, helicopters and jets) as a team. That's the season I give the high rating to! (True, there are still a lot of "liberties" taken in season 1, but the stories were more believable.)<br /><br />The subsequent seasons were a gawd-awful attempt of Melrose Place meets Top Gun! <br /><br />I was a Marine stationed at Miramar at the time and I remember them shooting the show around the San Diego area. I got to talk to Rod Rowland and James Brolin.<br /><br />Rowland's character was good to go.<br /><br />Brolin's character was good in the first season only. For some reason he slacked off after the first ep of the second season.<br /><br />If you want to see a LITTLE of how the Marine Air Ground team operates, then season one is the one to watch.<br /><br />If you're into Melrose Place and soap opera like plots with an attempt to merge them into Top Gun, then see the last two seasons.
