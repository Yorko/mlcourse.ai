Jim Henson as Kermit, Dr.Teeth, Rowlf and Waldorf.<br /><br />Frank Oz as Fozzie, Piggy and Animal.<br /><br />Jerry Nelson as Floyd Pepper, Robin the Frog, Lew Zealand and Crazy Harry.<br /><br />Richard Hunt as Janice, Statler,Beaker and Scooter.<br /><br />Dave Goelz as Gonzo, Dr.Hunnydew and Zoot.<br /><br />Charles Durning and Mel Brooks.<br /><br />cameos by Steve Martin, Carol Kane, Orson Welles, Bob Hope, Richard Pryor and others.<br /><br />This is the first Muppet movie of the billion others that came out, and is also the best, by far! This deals with Kermit the frog going on a trip to Hollywood and meeting the other characters along the way. This movie, along with being already good, has excellent songs performed by the Muppets, including Rainbow Connection, Can You Picture That?, Moving Right Along and others. This movie, unlike the other Muppet flicks, carries a strong sentimental value to me. It's such a nice movie. Also noted is it's many cameos featuring Steve Martin, Mel Brooks and a dozen others.<br /><br />my rating-A plus. 109 mins. rated G.
