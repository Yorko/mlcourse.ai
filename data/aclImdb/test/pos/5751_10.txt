I can't even begin to imagine why everyone hates this movie so much. It had me literally crying with laughter several times ("I trust you slept well?" "actually, we had a bit of a rough night." "ah, the perils of adultery.").<br /><br />admittedly, the ending is a little flat, but still has its moments (the booger ball's obvious fake spalsh as flew into the ocean, "beach house paradiso").<br /><br />personally, i think this is the funniest movie i've ever seen.<br /><br />10/10
