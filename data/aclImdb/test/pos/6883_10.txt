It's quite simple that those who call this movie anything below "decent" do not know their cinema. "The Doll Master" creates a sense of dread and suspense rarely seen in movies outside of Asia.<br /><br />Think of a mixture of "Manga" and "Ringu" rolled into one and this is what its all about.<br /><br />First rate acting, first rate direction, first rate sets and effects.<br /><br />This is right up there with the best of Asian horror cinema; Ringu, Dark Water and A Tale of Two Sisters.<br /><br />An absolute must. <br /><br />Take it from a guy who knows his movies.
