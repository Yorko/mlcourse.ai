I thought this movie was cleverly written and very well acted. Its a movie that greatly surpasses other films in terms of originality and enjoyment.Rupert Grint played the part marvelously, and has a general knack for the acting business. The almost obsessive mother added quite a lot to the plot, and was a character one could almost instantly loathe. This reminded me, in a way, of the Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. Not by means of actual content of the film, but the premises, and overall tone to the film itself. "Driving Lessons" is a coming of age story, which many might find very easy to relate to due to the overpowering mother, the lack of freedom, and the discovery of oneself.
