brilliant screenplay..<br /><br />the screenplay is very tight ..that u will be gelled in seat..<br /><br />this movie is an example for movie can survive only with screenplay and no-story needed..<br /><br />story is very simple that u can write in one line. but screenplay was amazing..<br /><br />brilliant performance by Vijay and Prakashraj..<br /><br />though plot is similar to okkadu.. director adapted only the plot. Tamil version is much fast paced than Telugu.<br /><br />Movie travels straight without any chance of deviation, though u can understand each and every characters back-drop.<br /><br />keep going
