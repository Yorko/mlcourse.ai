I just watched this film, and I have to say it surprised me. It was very well done, with good acting and a deep look at high school students from Japan, in adolescent love.<br /><br />The look and feel is a lot different from many movies, and you can easily get into the film. Much of the emphasis seems to be in the story itself, which is extremely subtle. The main theme and relations with other characters are a bit complex. But the the overall sense of realism and dimensions still pulls you in.<br /><br />A main draw back is of course, those who like something simple. Which is not here. You have to be open to many things, including a new culture, to get more into the film.<br /><br />I did enjoy this film though. It is worth watching.
