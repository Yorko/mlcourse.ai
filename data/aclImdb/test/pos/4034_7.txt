Those wishing to see film noir remakes, should not see this as as a remake, you will always be disappointed. Instead, enjoy a gripping performance from Dennis Quaid and visual imagery to commend.

The opening dialogue is clever, and the viewer is carried along by a sharp screenplay and a real, original film noir feel,
