A refreshing black comedy starring some of Australia's finest. In the same way that Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels captured the funny side of London gangsters, Two Hands rips through the Sydney underworld. It wouldn't be so funny if it wasn't so close to the bone.<br /><br />An Australian classic. If Australia could pull more rabbits like this out its hat it might actually have a film industry worth keeping an eye on.
