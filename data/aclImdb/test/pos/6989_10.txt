Oh my gosh! this was one of the best Sci-fi movies i have ever seen, and quite frankly i can't stand Sci-fi films.<br /><br />Vin Diesel and his co-workers made this movie really enjoyable!!<br /><br />I also must say that Vin diesel is by far the most sexiest and most talented male actors i have seen. Keep it up Vin! your doing great!! As for everyone else good job. i thought the drama and suspense kept the viewers really intrigued. again, great job everyone and i 'm rooting for you Vin.<br /><br />Sincerely yours, <br /><br />Alexandra
