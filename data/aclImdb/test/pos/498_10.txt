this film was brilliant! i absolutely loved it! wesley snipes was great for this role - and i'm sure blade 2 would be just as good.<br /><br />blade is by far one of my favorite action/horror movies out there! and if you havent seen it yet, and like vampires and blood (all that stuff) you should really rent it, because i assure you that you'll love it!
