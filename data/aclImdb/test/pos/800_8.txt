Good Film.<br /><br />I managed to pick this up on DVD in a local store sale. Â£2.99 seems like a good deal and it is. Thing is the film is named "To Kill For". It took a little detective work to find out it's original name.<br /><br />In the UK it has been rated as an 18 and rightly so although the standard of films depends on the "ability to sell". Having seen Final Destination 3 last night it, in my view, should have been a 18.<br /><br />Maybe the fact the delightful, Traci Lords is in it tends to make the classification board step it up to 18. Such a shame.<br /><br />Traci is a great actress and should be given the chance to appear in bigger and large budget productions. She ability to turn what is branded a B-Movies into a Fine performance is nothing short of amazing.<br /><br />Long Live Traci Lords and her incredible talent as an actress.
