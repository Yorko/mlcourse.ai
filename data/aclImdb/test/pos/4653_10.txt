I would love for members of the cast and crew to sit down and do an audio commentary on this movie! All of the different places that they went to film this movie! Should provide for some very good anecdotes! Fans of this movie would love to know:<br /><br />What kind of permission did they have to get to film at certain locations?<br /><br />Were there any memorable outtakes?<br /><br />Were there any scenes that were deleted?<br /><br />What challenges did the cast and the crew face?<br /><br />Did any actors have stunt doubles?<br /><br />What was it like to work with other members of the cast?<br /><br />Were any of the scenes ad libbed?<br /><br />What are members of the cast and crew up to now?<br /><br />What locations are still there, and what locations are no longer there, or are now a different business?<br /><br />It is one thing to read trivia about this movie on this site and other web sites. But there is just no comparison to getting it straight from the horse's mouth!<br /><br />Come on, guys! Get together and do a commentary! Never walk away from a challenge! Go for the gusto!
