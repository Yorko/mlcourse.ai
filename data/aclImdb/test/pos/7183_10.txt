Eh oui, impossible n'est pas gaulois.<br /><br />Well paced, highly entertaining film. Pretty good command of the French language and knowledge of modern France (and history) are recommended. I don't think this film really works in any other language. The film is incredibly much better than the previous one (In search of...). Apart from great actors and savvy camera handling it's the wit and firework of allusions, word plays etc. that make for a really great movie. The cartoon vorlage is recognizable but the film is very emancipated. The cost of the film is put to good use. Indeed, all the special effects fit 'naturally' into the movie, you never feel choked by them.<br /><br />Bref, oui, les 2CVs, ça traîne un peu mais à part cela, Imhotep!<br /><br />-A neighbour from the other side of the Rhine
