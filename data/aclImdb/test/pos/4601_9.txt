This movie was quite a pleasant surprise. I had anticipated it for a long time, and was afraid going in that it couldn't possibly live up to my expectations.<br /><br />It exceeded them.<br /><br />I adored this movie.<br /><br />Hilarious from start to finish (stay until after the end credits!), it is absolutely remarkable how a movie about dumb and annoying characters can be so intelligent, witty, and engaging.<br /><br />With it's obvious matte paintings, the movie's future Earth recalls the Planet of the Apes series and other Sci-Fi movies of that era.<br /><br />In fact, this movie is essentially Planet of the Apes, but with people who are the mental equivalent of apes.<br /><br />It moves at a fairly brisk pace, and Luke Wilson carries the movie quite well, with a character that recalls the one he played in "Bottle Rocket." (There's even a not-so-subtle nod to "Bottle Rocket" in an early scene).<br /><br />Maya Rudoulph is also surprisingly good as a former "painter" who was frozen as well.<br /><br />Despite all its strengths, "Idiocracy" has the distinct feel of a movie that was taken away from the director/editor before it could be fine-tuned.<br /><br />I cannot for the life of me understand why a movie this funny would just be dumped into a few theaters with no advanced screenings, no trailers, no marketing whatsoever.<br /><br />It's as if the studio decided they were not going to spend any more on it and just walked away.<br /><br />Or maybe they thought the movie had the makings of a cult classic, and the only way for it to become a true cult classic was to set it up to fail? <br /><br />Whatever the case, it is a shame, because Mike Judge and this film in particular deserve better.<br /><br />I predict this movie will have real legs on DVD, and word of mouth will propel it to the success it deserves.<br /><br />Perhaps the Fox Executives saw themselves in the characters, were confused, and thought it was a documentary?
