He's not your conventional cab driver.<br /><br />This guys got issues. With his wife, with his son, a priest, all his fares, his ex-partner and most of all himself. And the greatest thing is they just throw us all into it. So we have to keep watching to find out more about his past.<br /><br />The idea may not be original but David Morse makes it so. I think this is a great show, and I hope people catch-on before the season's over. <br /><br />WATCH THIS SHOW!!!!!!!!!
