It's become extremely difficult to find a good horror movie anymore, thought this movie was a good thriller.<br /><br />Could have had better production values but what kept me going was the suspense and the twists. I had real reservations before seeing this movie (because of the cover). I was afraid that it would be excessively bloody and gory. I was wrong.<br /><br />Although there is a lot of scary parts, there is a lot of suspense and drama too.<br /><br />The acting in Dead Line was better than what you would expect from a micro budget horror flick. The characters were believable<br /><br />The movie is really thrilling and quite scary at moments so it makes you grab your seat until the ending credits roll<br /><br />Because of its production values (the sound is not very good for example) 8/10.
