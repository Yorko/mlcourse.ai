I have enjoyed both of the Van Dykes over the years and was glad to watch them again.<br /><br />Just as cute and funny and easy to watch and enjoy.<br /><br />Dick was good when he was younger but I enjoyed him more as he got older.<br /><br />Son Berry has been a great one to follow in his fathers footsteps.<br /><br />Together they make a great team and work well together.<br /><br />I am disappointed that I have not found another Murder 101 listed anywhere.<br /><br />I have seen both of the ones that have been shown. I am hoping for more as it is really an enjoyable duo to watch.<br /><br />You can sure tell Berry follows in his dad footsteps, they talk alike and have the same mannerisms.<br /><br />Would enjoy anything they do separately.<br /><br />Will be sure to watch anything they do alone and together.
