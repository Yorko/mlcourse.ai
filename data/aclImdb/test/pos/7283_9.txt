Good movie, all elements of a good movie was there, story, actors, script, and direction. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.<br /><br />No question about it, is a low budget film, but I liked it more than many big budget films.<br /><br />Andres Bagg plays Martin Sanders, who is dealing with his unfaithful wife. Then a voice in the telephone and then just fear.<br /><br />Virginia Lustig is beautiful and brings a powerful performance. She is an excellent part to the film.<br /><br />I liked the increasing ambiguity near the end, even though we know that the main character can be involved, we continued seeing everything from his point of view and asking: Who is the killer?
