I really enjoyed this film. I'm not usually one for fairy tales or make believe storeys but this film captured my attention.<br /><br />I first saw this film on the UK channel Hallmark...which usually shows afew tacky films...but then Snow Queen came along...and I was loving it! I really really admire Bridget Fonda in this movie...she plays the snow queen brilliantly and glamorously.<br /><br />I won't explain what the story is about as other people have already done so, so there is no point repeating.<br /><br />I would just suggest that if you want to watch a fun fairy tale journey...get this film...but if you want to purchase it and you live in the UK, you might have a hard time. I've bought it from South Korea brand new (english edition of course).
