Wow, its been quite a while since I've watched anything so mysterious in the way it is portrayed.<br /><br />A Detective Story uses old fashioned black and white images to portray a private investigator who dresses in an old fashioned trench coat and hat. The theme of this animation is reminiscent of that of Sam Spayed which was briefly mentioned by Ash.<br /><br />Sick of spying on cheating house wives because of his clients, Ash was offered a chance to track down a "computer hacker" which he thought was a worthwhile chance for a four figure sum he could not turn down and the rest is history.<br /><br />The ending was a little bit bland but still okay. For those out there who like old fashion stories this is the one for you.
