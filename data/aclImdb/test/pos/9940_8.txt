If you're OK with the outlandish work of Italy's premier horror director혰able to accept his outrageous story lines and flamboyant style혰then you should have a great time with Opera. If you don't, then you won't.<br /><br />Cristina Marsillach plays Betty, a beautiful young opera understudy who is given a shot at fame (in an avant-garde production of Macbeth) when the star of the show is hit by a car. As any thesp who has 'trod the boards' will know, Macbeth is a production that carries a curse혰and Betty soon discovers that the show in which she is now the star is no exception: a killer is systematically offing the staff at the theatre혰and poor Betty is forced to watch by the sadistic murderer (who tapes needles under her eyes to prevent her from closing them!).<br /><br />With the help of a little girl who crawls through her air-conditioning ducts, her director and agent, and a few ravens who have seen the murderer's face (!!!), Betty discovers the killer's identity, and the truth about her mysterious past.<br /><br />Let's face it... Opera is one crazy film, with its preposterous plot-turns, convoluted death scenes, and an ending that beggars belief. And whilst director Dario Argento has never been one for, shall we say, conventional story lines, this particular giallo is so daft, and features so many of his trademark stylish touches (all ramped up to the max), that it's almost as if, with each successive film, he is seeing what he can get away with (at times almost parodying his earlier work).<br /><br />This is exactly why I find the film such fun!!!<br /><br />Argento's camera movements are absolutely incredible: gliding, creeping and, in one amazing scene, even swooping around the opera house above the audience; the power of Verdi's music is combined perfectly with the synth majesty of Claudio Simonetti's score, providing a suitably grandiose accompaniment to the sumptuous visuals; and several outstanding set-pieces (featuring Sergio Stivaletti's nauseating gore FX) go to prove that no-one does death better than Argento (check out one character's stunning demise, in which a bullet passes through a spy-hole in a door in slow motion, and straight into their eye!).<br /><br />7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.
