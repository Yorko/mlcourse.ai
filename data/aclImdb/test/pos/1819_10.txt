This gem captures early 80's life brilliantly. As a grad '83 boy<br /><br />myself, I must say that Valley Girl (along with Fast Times at<br /><br />Ridgemont High )stands out as the class of the teen sex film<br /><br />genre. The characters are accurate representatives of the era; the<br /><br />vapid mall chicks, pseudo punk rebels, preppy jocks are all<br /><br />represented here.<br /><br />I have seen this over ten times now. The music in the film was top<br /><br />notch. Unfortunately, these tunes could were never as popular in<br /><br />their era as those by arena cockrockers like Journey, Styx or<br /><br />Loverboy. Before the soundtrack existed, I searched out records<br /><br />and tapes (it was the 80's after all !) of Josie Cotton, Sparks,<br /><br />Plimsouls and Modern English.<br /><br />This movie deserves respect. It isn't just a good 80's teen flick. It is<br /><br />a great film. Period.
