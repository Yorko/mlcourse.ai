I love this movie, though I don't like how they picture Egyptians, being an Egyptian citizen myself! that's why it earns an eight out of 10.<br /><br />The relationship between Augustin and the leopard is awkward, and of course because of loneliness and living in that cave for quite so long, he develops a kind of insanity and passion to that leopard.<br /><br />A very touching scene when the leopard dies, watch Augustin's reaction.. <br /><br />All in all I find it enjoyable, and I'm looking forward to reading the short story by Balzac.
