This is a cult classic for sure!!<br /><br />It is tricky to follow at times, but then again, so is a film like Jacobs Ladder or even say Fight Club. If you want standard fare, then i figure go rent the Care Bears Movie or perhaps an old Disney classic. But if you want " to view the world differently" then i would say open yourself up to Enigma's and for that matter to a film that challenges what we see and think.<br /><br />For me the key is that the film was original and had me questioning throughout. So while i have seen some complaints, all in all i would say take the film for what it is and enjoy.
