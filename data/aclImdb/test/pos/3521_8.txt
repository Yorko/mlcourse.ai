Ignore the bad reviews on here, this film is awesome! "Just Before Dawn" is a great example of what can be done in a film with a minimal budget if you have a dedicated crew, decent script, and a cool idea for a film. It's a hell of a lot of fun.<br /><br />I enjoyed it a lot more than most other 80's slashers because the killer is so unique. "Wrong Turn" ripped this movie off something fierce! There's plenty of blood and scares. My girlfriend was freaked out and she watches almost everything with me and doesn't flinch. It's got that creepiness to it.<br /><br />I'd say that "Just Before Dawn" is the best early 80's slasher out there. I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />8 out of 10, kids.
