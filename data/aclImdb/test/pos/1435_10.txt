I saw this movie about 12 years ago and I can still remember it as if I just saw it recently. That is how much this movie has affected me.<br /><br />Considering this is a movie from the 50's I think it was ahead of its time. It surprised me as in how it maintains its integrity in this subject some might have considered taboo back then. Very realistic in showing the tumultuous and heartwretching journey that an addict chooses to embark on. One can only imagine how the audiences were affected by the realism of this movie back in those days.<br /><br />I personally think is was one of Frank Sinatra's top five performances in the big screen.<br /><br />When others are discussing movies dealing with Mental Illness and/or addiction I always recommend The Man with the Golden Arm as one of the top five to watch.
