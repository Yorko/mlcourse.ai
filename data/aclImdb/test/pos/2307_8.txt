If you like the excitement of a good submarine drama and the fun of a good comedy, then this film comes highly recommended. Kelsey Grammer gives an excellent performance here.<br /><br />The film also gives you something to think about the next time a serious sub movie asks for 'silent running'....<br /><br />
