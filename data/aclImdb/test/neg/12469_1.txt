Basic structure of a story: Beginning, Middle, End.<br /><br />Sometimes this structure is played with, and we get Memento or Irreversible and the story plays backwards. Sometimes it's just not linear, a la Pulp Fiction. Regardless, they all have a beginning, middle and end.<br /><br />This is the first film I have ever seen that doesn't have an end.<br /><br />Beginning: Girl's best friend is expelled.<br /><br />Middle: Girl needs to cope without best friend.<br /><br />End: Non existent.<br /><br />Not that having an end would've saved this film, but at least it would have been complete.<br /><br />It's an exercise in apathy; we get a party-mix of characters, and they all turn out to be duds. Boring, vain, vapid and pallid imitations of people.<br /><br />And here's the action within this film: NOTHING HAPPENS. Nothing at all happens. Mischa Barton tries to talk with a plummy English accent, Dominique Swain whines a lot and Brad Renfro receives a blow job from some old guy. End of movie.<br /><br />By the time the credits rolled, I had a horrible feeling that many prisoners must feel: periods of time, those precious minutes of our life, have just been wasted.<br /><br />The only passable point (and that is a very emphatic ONLY) is Brad Renfro. He acts well. Lacey Chabert I tend to like, but no luck here. Due to good work in other films, I will forgive Mischa Barton this travesty, but I hope all cast members were slapped in the face for their involvement.<br /><br />Please, I implore you. Avoid. Don't fool yourself into thinking "I'll make up my own mind". My sister told me to never see this, and I ignored her, wanting to make up my own mind. That was a bad decision.<br /><br />I have never hated a film. There are many I don't like, but I have never hated a film. Until I saw this.
