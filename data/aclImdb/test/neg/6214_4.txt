The Movie is not bad in itself...till you see the original movie Hitch(2005) starring Will Smith. The movie is a straight copy with even the dialogs for most part of the movie simply translated from English to Hindi! The plot in the original is tightly executed. The Hindi version fails to keep the viewers interested. The over-the-top kind of comedy of David Dhawan seems to have gone overboard with Govinda hysterically shouting at all times...sometimes more time is spent in understanding the reason for that than the plot. :)<br /><br />If you know English, which I assume you know given that you are reading this, see the Hollywood original. At least watch "Hitch" if you have watched Partner to be able to compare. This is the least we can do to support the creative geniuses whose work, I am sad to say, is shamelessly lifted by "inspired" people like David Dhawan.
