To truly appreciate this film you had to be there (acting?) or have been a crew member.<br /><br />Yes, I am "Selena", and at the ripe old age of 42, have serious doubts about what we were doing/did.<br /><br />It all started out to be like a "John Waters" type thing, friends acting badly in bad films. Somewhere along the line,the fun discontinued, people who were supposed to be friends didn't speak anymore, and BAD became worse.<br /><br />I regret the bad image I might have projected.(Try to fit in size one gold spandex pants,)<br /><br />Other than that, the film SUCKS so badly, I would not even make my mama watch it.<br /><br />To my director, cast and crew I say,<br /><br />"Why can't we just all get along??<br /><br />It's been OVER TWENTY YEARS, PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
