OK, here's the short of it... this movie is full of corny dialogue, over the top acting, and a threadbare script.<br /><br />There are moments that intended to be very dramatic but simply come off humorous because of the over the top acting and poorly written lines. I couldn't help laughing at moments that were meant to be very serious. The bright spot in this movie is the circus. Seeing the circus in its heyday was certainly a treat.<br /><br />There are moments that come through as good. But then it nosedives right back into B-movie territory. I was tempted to stop watching it several times.<br /><br />I certainly don't know how it won best picture, however. It must have been a slow year!
