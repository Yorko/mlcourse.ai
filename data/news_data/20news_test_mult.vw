are would echo that question not trying contentious but assuming that the pope has universal jurisdiction and authority what authority you rely upon for your decisions what prevents from choosing any doctrine like and saying that papal disagreement error that will resolved time this especially true since councils bishops have basically stood the pope the ultimate question the traditional theology the church this the only thing that possible resist pope for his departure from the traditional doctrine the church commands from any authority conflict with tradition the commands must disobeyed own view this that this conflict could only happen major way god would never allow hair splitting situation develop would too complex for people figure out don view the present situation the church anything extremely complicated run through list what has happened the last years the catholic church and any impartial observer will aghast appears that much what lies the heart this matter disagreements over what tradition and tradition and also over authority and discipline the problems stem from general widespread ignorance the catholic faith opinion most catholics know about zilch about the catholic faith this leaves them wide open for destruction erring bishops basically the reformation part there not even question mind that some respects the shards the catholic church are currently being trampled upon the catholic hierarchy could listing shocking things for hour probably take the situation campos brazil for example reading book what happened there after vatican council the bishop antonio castro mayer never introduced all the changes that followed the wake vatican kept the traditional mass the same old catechisms etc made sure the people knew their faith the catholic theology obedience what modernism was etc innoculated the people against what was coming well one day the order came from rome for his retirement came when the pope was sick bishop castro mayer waited until the pope recovered then inquired whether this command was what the pope really wanted something that some liberal had commanded his absence the pope confirmed the decision the good bishop retired the injustice that followed was completely incredible new bishop was installed proceeded expel most bishop castro mayer clergy from their churches because they refused celebrate the new mass the new bishop would visit parish and celebrate new mass the people would promptly walk out the church masse the bishop was enraged this usually resorted enlisting the help the secular authorities eject the priest from the church the priests would just start building new churches the people were completely behind them the old parishes had the new mass the bishop desired and virtually parishioners the prime motivation for all this was completely illegal according canon law priest can penalized any way for saying the traditional mass because legislation enacted pope saint pius nor there any obligation say the new mass during all this process the people campos not just private individuals but including civil authorities were constantly sending petitions and letters rome something about the new modernist bishop nothing was ever done help ever arrived from rome eventually priests were kicked out and about 000 people question the supporters sspx this there any way that your positions with respect church reforms could change and conformed those the pope assuming that the pope position does not change and that the leaders sspx don jointly make such choice not this appears claiming infallible teaching authority adopt the view that not wrong can wrong and there way change mind you must change yours that either left the catholic church has left the pope defines certain things cathedra that would the end the controversy that process all very well understood catholic theology and anyone who doesn along with instant non catholic the problem here that people not appreciate what going the catholic world they knew the faith and what our bishops are doing they would shocked sould argue from now until the second coming about what the real traditional teaching the church this were simple matter east and west would not have been separated for over 900 years this isn the case the catholic church there massive body traditional teaching the popes the last 150 years are especially relevant there question all what the traditional doctrine thought that the teaching magisterieum the church did not allow error teachings regarding faith and morals even the short term may wrong here not roman catholic that heresy more less although they have done great job since the reformation the last years have seen many errors spread that pitiful infallibility rests the pope and the church whole the short term pope large sections the church can astray fact that what usually happens during major heresy large sections the church astray the pope historically has been much more reliable everything will always come back the long run what would the effect pope making cathedra statement regarding the sspx situation would honored not how you get around the formal doctrine infallibility again not trying contentions trying understand since orthodox got real vested interest the outcome one way the other yes would honored infallibility infallibility but what going define that the new mass better expression the catholic faith than the old that sex education the catholic schools wonderful that all religions are wonderful except for that professed the popes prior vatican does the command was legitimate sspx does not view the pope commands legitimate why this very slippery slope not really start studying the major catholic theologians the last 300 years everything very

are you calling names giving title the first read your paragraph above not accept the title order let you get into the well debate again hasan replies didnot know that master wisdom can name clling too unless you consider yourself deserve less unless you are referring someone else you have fact given name did not ask for hence the term name calling hasan writes what you expect tell you tell you master wsidom replied you insist giving names titles did not ask for you could least spell them correctly sigh hasan gloats that was only confuse you hey hell bent retarding into childhood when you are intentionally neglecting the most important fact that the whole israeli presence the occupied territories illegitimate and hence all their actions their courts their laws are illegitimate the ground occupied territories _not_ neglecting that merely asking you whether the existance israeli citicens the gaza invalidates those individuals right are you trying retaliate and confuse here really try spell correctly and apologize did confuse you will try not repeat that live you eloquently put human right can get back the question which law should used the territories later also you have not adressed question the israelis also have human rights first above statement doesnot say that the existence israeli citizens the revoke their right life but says the israeli occupation the revoke the right life for some most its citizens basically revokes the right for its military men clearly occupation undeclared war during war attacks against military targets are fully legitimate let phrase the question have repeatedly asked you the israelis have less human rights than the palestinians and why from your posting where you did not directly adress question inferred that you thought together with the above statement then assumed that the reason was the actions the state israel your statement occupation like you define the term don have repeat this drag the answer out hasan procedure more than neccesary secondly surely israeli have human rights but they ask their goverment protect withdrawing from the occupied terretories not further oppressing palestinean human rights sorry but the above sentence does not make sense please rephrase state can deprive all citizens human rights its actions then tell why _any_ human living today should have any rights all because not all states are like israel oppressive ignorant tyrant how about the human rights the syrians iraqis and others does the name hama sound familiar how about the kurds iraq and turkey how about the same sweden maybe bit farfetched the russians the baltic states the moslem the old ussr and yugoslavia the serbs have any human rights remainaing according you and which system you propose use solve the problem the question not which system would solve the problem why because any system can solve the laws minister sharon says kick palestineans out here all palestine asked for which system should used that will preserve human rights for all people involved assumed that was obvious but won repeat that mistake now that have straightened that out eagerly awaiting your reply you agree that that israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights understanding this from your first statement this paragraph agreeing that just kick all the palestinians out israel proper would probably lead disaster for both parties that what you refer the israeli solution then joseph weitz administrator responsible for jewish colonization said best when writing his diary 1940 between ourselves must clear that there room for both peoples together this country shall not achieve our goal being independent people with the arabs this small country the only solution palestine least western palestine west the jordan river without arabs and there other way than transfer the arabs from here the neighbouring countries transfer all them not one village not one tribe should left only after this transfer will the country able absorb the millions our own brethren there other way out davar september 1967 courtesy marc afifi just question are disregard the rather obvious references getting israel out one way the other both plo covenant and hamas charter that the english translations you have other information interested have you translate why should give any credence _private_ paper even older not going get into the question wrote the above but fairly obvious all parties the conflict have their share fanatics guess what those are not the people that will make any lasting peace the region more deleted stuff exactly you are right guess that the problem that the israeli goverment full with men like joseph weitz have you met with them personally read their diaries fascinating what you _do_ for living and our either refers zionists jews donot know which well can give you answer you master wisdom will not suggest the imperialist israeli system for solving the problem think that fair enough that _not_ answer since asked for system that could solve the problem you said any could used then you provided contradiction above you wrote that you understood what meant underlined any system can used solve the conflict but not any system would resolve justly unjust solution would non solution per definition you said the following for all holds that have property there exists such that property does not hold thus either both statements must false guess where that takes your logic never never land you are proving yourself first you understood what meant but then you claim you didnot claim contradiction logic too bad for you the master wisdom was merely pointing out not small flaw your reasoning since you claim logical felt best point this out before you started using your statements prove point then assume you are not logical the greatest problem zionism arab children rabbi shoham and the way let add that these cute quotes you put the end are real bummer when try giving your posts any credit why you feel ashamed things and facts that you believe you were zionists you believe zionist codes and acts well feel sorry for you because the same rabbi shoham had said yes zionism racism you feel ashamed and bothered the zionist codes then drop zionism you are not zionist why are you bothered then you should join condemning these racist zionist codes and acts any quote can misused especially when used stereotype all individuals statement individual you use the same methods that you credit zionists with then where does that place you the way advice you not assume anything about loyalties will and condemning acts find vile and inhuman but try long can not assume those acts are whole people zionist above you mean the state israel the government israel the leaders israel political and religious the jews general you feel the need condemn condemn those responsible instead how would you feel started condemning you personally based the bombings egypt jonas

writes hello fellow netters and fellow christians about the subject unity between christians and christian churches bible study group alltough have personal opinion this issue thought would nice hear opinions fellow christian brothers and sisters from different countries and different situations background member orthodox reformed church let say little the only unity found which true when all parties involved are disciples came out church which even the different congregations were always competing and arguing about which one was better and who had the better messages while none them put anything into practice from those messages since becoming disciple found that when travel another church the same movement they are just accepting there any other had retreat back january when some the congregation from louisville came this retreat was for college students and was though had known even the people from louisville for years and had only become disciple the previous april and had never been the church kentucky one the keys unity unselfish love and self sacrifice that only one area which disciples stand out from christians also another part unity common depth conviction also been part some christian campus fellowships who were focused unity between churches and saw that those churches had one thing involved lack conviction about everything they believed that was why they could unified they didn care about the truth but delighted getting along together the problem here the netherlands that there are two other churches denominations with the same characteristics both have the same confessions there are only some differences with respect for example the matter appropriation salvation and how use our creeds essence lot people these three churches have same faith and feel that they should become one church but how that the question creeds what need there creeds when the bible stands firmly better here first question can the congregation christ separated walls different denominations this definitely untolerable situation according the scriptures according the scriptures splits and differences opinion are going there per previous note mentioned that there are those who teach falsely many means there are also differences opinion and belief however scripture states the following directives have praise for you for your meetings more harm than good the first place hear that when you come together church there divisions among you and some extent believe doubt there have differences among you show which you have god approval corinthians how will god show his approval fruitfulness see acts but before that there are these qualities devotion the apostles teaching fellowship communion filling with awe for god all having everything common glad and sincere hearts praising god enjoying the favor the people all these are mentioned acts god also shows that those who have these qualities are persecuted look stephen man full faith and the holy spirit acts who was later stoned acts can one say that only one these three churches the true church jesus christ one can say that church the true church only that church perfect not only the congregation but worldwide movement have yet find that but the closest one found the boston church christ movement which constantly strives have errors pointed out and corrected also the only one seen which totally sold out god problem closely related these question can cooperate with other christians from these two churches before there unity this question especially important for those who think that only one church can the true one for cooperation that can always occur unity the other hand may never occur for those who think about only one church being the true one remind them that mark states that there are disciples who are not part the main group begin with but they will not lose their reward with the boston movement heard numerous times this exact same thing that there are disciples out there that are not part the boston movement but that does not make them any less disciples course few people admit that they ever run into someone who has the qualities disciple outside the movement know haven maybe this last problem sounds little strange most you for your information have lot organizations here which are founded people one specific church and whose members are all members that church this has been considered correct for years only few years ago people started discuss about this and now are the middle this process some organizations are opening their doors for people from other churches etc must warn that this sounds cliquey clique group which runs around together some extent exclusively this causes problems fellowship and causes divisions would not say all that this something correct for church group for any reason one the churches attended for example there was internal clique people who were the different groups committees organizational heads the congregation they rarely talked anyone else outside the committees and seldom were voted out office without another office being opened that they would have step right back their degree exclusion was such that when the new pastor came nearly had wipe out everything and start from scratch wish would since they still have clue about what means disciple anyway this rigidity the clique beginning broken down but still there must warn against such division within there enough division without thanks for your opinions advance maarten joe fisher

hunt bluelobster cmu edu writes pretty sure seen biblical rules for when allowable rape prisoners what the codes are about that etc could some more knowledgable soul than please let know some references asked very narrow question and gave very narrow answer yes sorry have got that wrong apology deletion david hunt post didn mention god nor did response you were the first bring the idea the bible being given god most jews don believe this any literal sense fun but must have met the minority then and given god refers any action whereby god god causes better effects something rob not intimate with jewish theology but understand that you are messianic jew correct wrong but appears that the views messianic jews metaphysics different that the majority jews while jewish theology overall quite distinct from the christianic god views have heard that possible for jews attribute evil their god for christians the bible still seen effect the interaction some god with man deletion thought agreed that though jews disagree there are set core beliefs that they agree upon one which that the commandments are accessible and written the language the time and another which that there must legal system update them the context was metaphysics even when the process adapting the commandments not transcendent the justification the process lie metaphysic specualtion wonder how you break out the shackles having metaphysics your system deletion could you explain this with respect the original commandments being discussed that the commandment that says you feel like raping woman prisoner you should instead wait and marry her what about the way this commandment given invalidates book that commands commit genocide among other reprehensible deeds the context repulsive and foul play imo invoke some relatively enlightened passages example for the content the whole book big deletion the point that see that there necessary connection between the theology you use and the interpretation the bible only very loosely interpretation the bible based long tradition jewish scholars interpreting the bible theology doesn really enter into there are jewish atheists who interpret the laws charity essentially the same way not the interpretation some laws but the interpretation the bible the example that sodom and gomorrha mean argue with god the whole idea that metaphorically and yet allows you argue with god whatever that means that alone theo logic question proof theology used you pose another metaphysical riddle you well you wrote this fine have some major spirit with neither absolute power nor absolute knowledge and appears limited means will communicate with some form spiritual big friend you admit that using god this context somewhat unusual right the assumption that cannot have created the universe well and that the passages the bible referring that its omnipotence are crap that what meant the riddle important question the light what for instance the passage witrh sodom and gomorrha means either there some connection between the text the fact that exists and your interpretation purely arbitrary further the question why has one carry the burden biblical texts when one could simply write other books that convey the message better you might answer that one can becuase some peculiar biblical information might lost but that holds true every other book and the question remains why has the bible still special place can replaced somehow bargain the dangerous content the bible against some other message that included well deletion you see the danger doing especially with the metaphers used the bible think the danger doing less than either the danger having frozen system laws having laws sorry but there are worse systems does not say anything about one could not have better system deletion read two stories about the importance helping the poor and one god spirit and the other god has body which more important helping the poor resolving the contradiction about the corporeal nature god read two stories the bible one that god commands people kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills children directly what more important resolve the message that children are killed has done god and the argument you have given fallacy while may not important the context you have given find out god corporeal not can crucial other questions religious believers resolve contradictions with that they choose one the possibilities given arbitrary way and have the advantage being able attribute their decision some god one cannot resolve questions the statement what good when what good depends the question benedikt

such path myname mysite specify your correct mail address reply what jpeg jpeg pronounced jay peg standardized image compression mechanism jpeg stands for joint photographic experts group the original name the committee that wrote the standard jpeg designed for compressing either full color gray scale digital images natural real world scenes does not work well non realistic images such cartoons line drawings jpeg does not handle black and white bit per pixel images nor does handle motion picture compression standards for compressing those types images are being worked other committees named jbig and mpeg respectively jpeg lossy meaning that the image you get out decompression isn quite identical what you originally put the algorithm achieves much its compression exploiting known limitations the human eye notably the fact that small color details aren perceived well small details light and dark thus jpeg intended for compressing images that will looked humans you plan machine analyze your images the small errors introduced jpeg may problem for you even they are invisible the eye useful property jpeg that the degree lossiness can varied adjusting compression parameters this means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality you can make extremely small files you don mind poor quality this useful for indexing image archives making thumbnail views icons etc etc conversely you aren happy with the output quality the default compression setting you can jack the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression why use jpeg there are two good reasons make your image files smaller and store bit per pixel color data instead bit per pixel data making image files smaller big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries images being able compress mbyte full color file down 100 kbytes makes big difference disk space and transmission time you are comparing gif and jpeg the size ratio more like four one more details below your viewing software doesn support jpeg directly you have convert jpeg some other format for viewing manipulating images even with jpeg capable viewer takes longer decode and view jpeg image than view image simpler format gif for instance thus using jpeg essentially time space tradeoff you give some time order store transmit image more cheaply worth noting that when network phone transmission involved the time savings from transferring shorter file can much greater than the extra time decompress the file let you the arithmetic yourself the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif standard usenet posting format that jpeg can store full color information bits pixel million colors instead less 256 fewer colors you have only bit display hardware then this may not seem like much advantage you within couple years though bit gif will look obsolete black and white macpaint format does today furthermore for reasons detailed section jpeg far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware hence jpeg considerably more appropriate than gif for use usenet posting standard when should use jpeg and when should stick with gif jpeg not going displace gif entirely for some types images gif superior image quality file size both one the first things learn about jpeg which kinds images apply rule thumb jpeg superior gif for storing full color gray scale images realistic scenes that means scanned photographs and similar material jpeg superior even you don have bit display hardware and lot superior you see section for details gif does significantly better images with only few distinct colors such cartoons and line drawings particular large areas pixels that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed gif jpeg can squeeze these files much gif does without introducing visible defects this sort image best kept gif form particular single color borders are quite cheap gif files but they should avoided jpeg files jpeg also has hard time with very sharp edges row pure black pixels adjacent row pure white pixels for example sharp edges tend come out blurred unless you use very high quality setting again this sort thing not found scanned photographs but shows fairly often gif files borders overlaid text etc the blurriness particularly objectionable with text that only few pixels high you have gif with lot small size overlaid text don jpeg computer drawn images ray traced scenes for instance usually fall between scanned images and cartoons terms complexity the more complex and subtly rendered the image the more likely that jpeg will well the same goes for semi realistic artwork fantasy drawings and such plain black and white two level images should never converted jpeg you need least about gray levels before jpeg useful for gray scale images should also noted that gif lossless for gray scale images 256 levels while jpeg not you have existing library gif images you may wonder whether you should convert them jpeg you will lose little image quality you section which argues that jpeg image quality superior gif only applies both formats start from full color original you start from gif you already irretrievably lost great deal information jpeg can only make things worse however the disk space savings may justify converting anyway this decision you have make for yourself you convert gif library jpeg see section for hints prepared leave some images gif format since some gifs will not convert well how well does jpeg compress images pretty darn well here are some sample file sizes for image have handy 727x525 full color image ship harbor the first three files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free jpeg software described section file size bytes comments ship ppm 1145040 original file ppm format compression bits bytes per pixel plus few bytes overhead ship ppm 963829 ppm file passed through unix compress compress doesn accomplish lot you note other text oriented compressors give similar results ship gif 240438 converted gif with ppmquant 256 ppmtogif most the savings the result losing color info gif saves bits pixel not see sec ship jpg95 155622 cjpeg highest useful quality setting this indistinguishable from the bit original least nonprofessional eyeballs ship jpg75 58009 cjpeg default setting you have look mighty darn close distinguish this from the original even with both screen once ship jpg50 38406 cjpeg this has slight defects you know what look for you could tell been jpeged without seeing the original still good image quality many recent postings usenet pictures groups ship jpg25 25192 cjpeg jpeg characteristic blockiness becomes apparent this setting djpeg blocksmooth helps some still seen plenty usenet postings that were poorer image quality than this ship jpg5o 6587 cjpeg optimize optimize cuts table overhead blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview indexing purposes note that this file tiny the compression ratio from the original 173 this case jpeg can make file that factor four five smaller than gif comparable quality the file every bit good the gif better you have full color display this seems typical ratio for real world scenes what are good quality settings for jpeg most jpeg compressors let you pick file size image quality tradeoff selecting quality setting there seems widespread confusion about the meaning these settings quality does not mean keep the information some have claimed the quality scale purely arbitrary not percentage anything the name the game using jpeg pick the lowest quality setting smallest file size that decompresses into image indistinguishable from the original this setting will vary from one image another and from one observer another but here are some rules thumb the default quality setting very often the best choice this setting about the lowest you can without expecting see defects typical image try first you see defects then except for experimental purposes never above saying 100 will produce file two three times large but hardly any better quality the image was less than perfect quality begin with you might able down without objectionable degradation the other hand you might need higher quality setting avoid further degradation the second case seems apply much the time when converting gifs jpeg the default about right for compressing bit images but usually better for converting gifs see section for more info you want very small file say for preview indexing purposes and are prepared tolerate large defects setting the range about right may amusing art note the quality settings discussed this article apply the free jpeg software described section and many programs based other jpeg implementations such image alchemy may use completely different quality scale some programs don even provide numeric scale just high medium low style choices where can get jpeg software most the programs described this section are available ftp you don know how use ftp see the faq article how find sources you don have direct access ftp read about ftpmail servers the same article that article

software viewers etc the first part this list system specific programs that only run one kind system you don see what you want for your machine check out the portable jpeg software described the end the list note that this list concentrates free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet but some commercial programs are listed too windows john bradley free version and excellent viewer for jpeg gif and other image formats available for ftp from export lcs mit edu ftp cis upenn edu the file called tar where the version number currently located the contrib directory export the pub directory upenn reduces all images bits internally which means not real good choice you have bit display you still get only bit color also you shouldn use convert full color images jpeg because they get color quantized first but fine tool for converting gif and other bit images jpeg caution there glitch versions and earlier sure check the save normal size checkbox when saving jpeg file the file will blurry another good choice for windows john cristy free imagemagick package also available from export lcs mit edu file contrib imagemagick tar this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks the imagemagick viewer handles bit displays correctly for colormapped displays does better though slower color quantization than the basic free jpeg software both the above are large

memory manager qemm386 and 386max work windows and not hiview currently the fastest viewer for images that are bigger than your screen for larger images scales the image down fit the screen rather than using panning scrolling most viewers you may may not prefer this approach but there denying that slows down loading large images considerably note installation bit tricky read the directions carefully shareware alternative colorview for dos this easier install than either the two freeware alternatives its user interface also much spiffier looking although personally find harder use more keystrokes inconsistent behavior faster than dvpeg but little slower than hiview least hardware for images larger than screen size dvpeg and colorview seem about the same speed and both are faster

get quicktime ftp from ftp apple com file dts mac quicktime quicktime hqx this file contains quicktime which better than several ways with respect jpeg marginally faster and considerably less prone crash when fed corrupt jpeg file however some applications seem have compatibility problems with mac users should keep mind that quicktime jpeg format pict jpeg not the same the usenet standard jfif jpeg format see section for details you post images usenet make sure they are jfif format most the programs mentioned below can generate either format the first choice probably jpegview free program for viewing images that are jfif format pict jpeg format gif format also can convert between the two jpeg formats the current version big improvement over prior versions get from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac app jpeg view hqx requires system and quicktime bit displays jpegview usually produces the best color image quality all the currently available mac jpeg viewers jpegview can view large images much less memory than other mac viewers fact the only one that can deal with jpeg images much over 640x480 pixels typical 4mb mac given large image jpegview automatically scales down fit the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers you can zoom any desired portion though some people like this behavior some don overall jpegview user interface very well thought out gifconverter shareware image viewer converter supports jfif and pict jpeg well gif and several other image formats the latest version get from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac art gif gif

its shareware fee you lot playing around with images also the newest version gifconverter can load and save jfif images without quicktime your best bet your machine too old run quicktime but faster with quicktime note gifconverter runs out memory trying load large jpeg try converting the file gif with jpeg convert then viewing the gif version jpeg convert mac version the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities available from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac app jpeg convert hqx this will run any mac but only does file conversion not viewing you can use conjunction with any gif viewer previous

was intended developer tool and really not the best choice unless you like fool around with quicktime some its drawbacks are that requires lots memory produces relatively poor color image quality anything less than bit display and has relatively unfriendly user interface worse pictpixie unsupported program meaning has some minor bugs that apple does not intend fix there old version pictpixie called pictcompressor floating around the net you have this you should trash even buggier also the quicktime starter kit includes much cleaned descendant pictpixie called picture compressor note that picture compressor not free and may not distributed the net storm technology picture decompress free jpeg viewer converter this rather old program inferior the above programs many ways but will run

volunteer organization you like contribute improving our software you are welcome join what all this hoopla about color quantization most people don have full color bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware stores fewer bits per pixel can display 256 fewer distinct colors time display full color image the computer must map the image into appropriate set representative colors this process called color quantization this something misnomer color selection would better term stuck with the standard usage though clearly color quantization lossy process turns out that for most images the details the color quantization algorithm have much more impact the final image quality than any errors introduced jpeg except the very lowest jpeg quality settings since jpeg full color format converting color jpeg image for display bit less hardware requires color quantization this true for all color jpegs even you feed 256 less color gif into jpeg what comes out the decompressor not 256 colors but thousands colors this happens because jpeg lossiness affects each pixel little differently two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors each original color gets smeared into group nearby colors therefore quantization always required display color jpeg colormapped display regardless the image source the only way avoid quantization ask for gray scale output incidentally because this effect nearly meaningless talk about the number colors used jpeg image even you attempted count the number distinct pixel values different jpeg decoders would give you different results because roundoff error differences occasionally see posted images described 256 color jpeg this tells that the poster hasn read this faq and probably converted the jpeg from gif jpegs can classified color gray scale just like photographs but number colors just isn useful concept for jpeg the other hand gif image definition has already been quantized 256 fewer colors gif does have definite number colors its palette and the format doesn allow more than 256 palette entries for purposes usenet picture distribution gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization recipients don have this also the disadvantage gif you stuck with the sender quantization the sender quantized different number colors than what you can display you have quantize resulting much poorer image quality than you had quantized once from full color image furthermore the sender didn use high quality color quantization algorithm you out luck for this reason jpeg offers the promise significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don match the sender display hardware jpeg full color image can quantized precisely match the user display hardware furthermore you will able take advantage future improvements quantization algorithms there lot active research this area purchase better display hardware get better view jpeg images you already have with gif you stuck forevermore with what was sent also worth mentioning that many gif viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines you view 256 color gif color ega display for example you are probably getting much worse image than you need this partly inevitable consequence doing two color quantizations one create the gif one display but often also due sloppiness jpeg conversion programs will forced use high quality quantizers order get acceptable results all and normal use they will quantize directly the number colors displayed thus jpeg likely provide better results than the average gif program for low color resolution displays well high resolution ones finally ever growing number people have better than bit display hardware already bit color displays true bit displays workstations and macintoshes etc for these people gif already obsolete cannot represent image the full capabilities their display jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively thus jpeg all around better choice than gif for representing images machine independent fashion how does jpeg work the buzz words know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and huffman arithmetic entropy coding this article long enough already not going say more than that here for technical information see the comp compression faq this available from the news answers archive rtfm mit edu files pub usenet news answers compression faq part you need help using the news answers archive see the top this article what about lossless jpeg there great deal confusion this subject the jpeg committee did define truly lossless compression algorithm one that guarantees the final output bit for bit identical the original input however this lossless mode has almost nothing common with the regular lossy jpeg algorithm and offers much less compression present very few implementations lossless jpeg exist and all them are commercial saying 100 the free jpeg software does not get you lossless image what does get rid deliberate information loss the coefficient quantization step there still good deal information loss the color subsampling step with the free jpeg code you can also say sample 1x1 turn off subsampling keep mind that many commercial jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular jpeg algorithm not lossless because subject roundoff errors various calculations the maximum error few counts any one pixel value highly unlikely that this could perceived the human eye but might concern you are doing machine processing image this minimum loss setting regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size uncompressed bit per pixel image true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount compression but guarantees bit for bit accuracy you have application requiring lossless storage images with less than bits per pixel per color component you may want look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard this performs better than jpeg lossless such images jpeg lossless superior jbig images with more bits per pixel furthermore jpeg public domain least with huffman back end while the jbig techniques are heavily covered patents why all the argument about file formats strictly speaking jpeg refers only family compression algorithms does not refer specific image file format the jpeg committee was prevented from defining file format turf wars within the international standards organizations since can actually exchange images with anyone else unless agree common file format this leaves with problem the absence official standards number jpeg program writers have just gone off their own thing and result their programs aren compatible with anybody else the closest thing have facto standard jpeg format some work that been coordinated people cube microsystems they have defined two jpeg based file formats jfif jpeg file interchange format low end format that transports pixels and not much else tiff jpeg aka tiff extension the aldus tiff format tiff high end format that will let you record just about everything you ever wanted know about image and lot more besides tiff lot more complex than jfif and may well prove less transportable because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different and incompatible subsets tiff not likely that adding jpeg the mix will anything improve this situation both these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors jpeg related products reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere one both standards believe that usenet should adopt jfif the replacement for gif picture postings jfif simpler than tiff and available now the tiff spec has only recently been officially adopted and still unusably vague some crucial details even when tiff jpeg well defined the jfif format likely widely supported lowest common denominator tiff jpeg files may never transportable particular case that people may interested apple quicktime software for the macintosh quicktime uses jfif compatible format wrapped inside the mac specific pict structure conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg pretty straightforward and several mac programs are available see mac portion section you have editor that handles binary files you can strip quicktime jpeg pict down jfif hand see section for details another particular case handmade software programs gif2jpg jpg2gif and image alchemy these programs are capable reading and writing jfif format default though they write proprietary format developed hsi this format not readable any non hsi programs and should not used for usenet postings use the switch get jfif output this applies old versions these programs the current releases emit jfif format default you still should careful not post hsi format files unless you want get flamed people non platforms how recognize which file format have and what about you have alleged jpeg file that your software won read likely hsi format some other proprietary jpeg based format you can tell what you have inspecting the first few bytes the file jfif standard file will start with the characters hex followed two variable bytes often hex followed jfif you see the start but not the rest you may have raw jpeg file this probably decodable jfif software worth try anyway hsi files start with hsi1 you out luck unless you have hsi software portions the file may look like plain jpeg data but they won decompress properly with non hsi programs macintosh pict file jpeg compressed will have couple hundred bytes header followed jfif header scan for jfif strip off everything before the and you should able read anything else proprietary format not jpeg all you are lucky the file may consist header and raw jpeg data stream you can identify the start the jpeg data stream look for try stripping off everything before that uuencoded usenet postings the characteristic jfif pattern begin line c_x whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with begin line you learn check for the former you can save yourself the trouble downloading non jfif files what about arithmetic coding the jpeg spec defines two different back end modules for the final output compressed data either huffman coding arithmetic coding allowed the choice has impact image quality but arithmetic coding usually produces smaller compressed file typical images arithmetic coding produces file percent smaller than huffman coding all the file size numbers previously cited are for huffman coding unfortunately the particular variant arithmetic coding specified the jpeg standard subject patents owned ibm and mitsubishi thus you cannot legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses from these companies the fair use doctrine allows people implement and test the algorithm but actually storing any images with dubious best least the short run recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding the space savings isn great enough justify the potential legal hassles particular arithmetic coding should not used for any images exchanged usenet there some small chance that the legal situation may change the future stay tuned for further details does loss accumulate with repeated compression decompression would nice having compressed image with jpeg you could decompress manipulate crop off border say and recompress without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially unfortunately this not the case general recompressing altered image loses more information though usually not much was lost the first time around the next best thing would that you decompress image and recompress without changing then there further loss you get identical jpeg file even this not true least not with the current free jpeg software essentially problem accumulation roundoff error you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade where you can see visible changes from the first generation output usually takes many such cycles get visible change one the things our list see accumulation error can avoided limited but not optimistic about any case the most that could possibly guaranteed would that compressing the unmodified full color output djpeg the original quality setting would introduce further loss even such simple changes cropping off border could cause further roundoff error degradation you wondering why because the pixel block boundaries move you cropped off only multiples pixels you might safe but that mighty limited capability the bottom line that jpeg useful format for archival storage and transmission images but you don want use intermediate format for sequences image manipulation steps use lossless format ppm rle tiff etc while working the image then jpeg when you are ready file away aside from avoiding degradation you will save lot compression decompression time this way what are some rules thumb for converting gif images jpeg stated earlier you will lose some amount image information you convert existing gif image jpeg you can obtain the original full color data the gif was made from far better make jpeg from that but you need save space and have only the gif work from here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss quality the first rule when converting gif library look each jpeg make sure you are happy with before throwing away the corresponding gif that will give you chance the conversion with higher quality setting necessary some gifs may better left gifs explained section particular cartoon type gifs with sixteen fewer colors don convert well you may find that jpeg file reasonable quality will larger than the gif check the sizes too experience date suggests that large high visual quality gifs are the best candidates for conversion jpeg they chew the most storage offer the most potential savings and they convert jpeg with least degradation don waste your time converting any gif much under 100 kbytes also don expect jpeg files converted from gifs small those created directly from full color originals maintain image quality you may have let the converted files much twice big straight through jpeg files would shoot for 3rd the size the gif file not 4th suggested earlier comparisons many people have developed odd habit putting large constant color border around gif image while useless this was nearly free terms storage cost gif files not free jpeg files and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ghost edges yourself favor and crop off any border before jpeging you are windows system manual and automatic cropping functions are very painless way this cjpeg default setting appropriate for full color input but for gif inputs settings often seem necessary avoid image degradation you apply smoothing suggested below the higher setting may not necessary color gifs photographs complex artwork are usually dithered fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that gif can actually store you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often significantly different colors normal size the eye averages these pixels together produce the illusion intermediate color value the trouble with dithering that jpeg looks like high spatial frequency color noise and jpeg can compress noise very well the resulting jpeg file both larger and lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image you had get around this you want smooth the gif image before compression smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway and the process getting rid the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble appropriate use smoothing will often let you avoid using high factor thus further reducing the size the compressed file while still obtaining better looking output image than you get without smoothing with the free jpeg software products based simple smoothing capability built try smooth when converting gifs values seem work well for high quality gifs heavy handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors you can see regular fine scale patterns the gif image even without enlargement then strong smoothing definitely called for too large smoothing factor will blur the output image which you don want you are image processing wizard you can also smoothing with separate filtering program such pnmconvol from the pbmplus package however cjpeg built smoother lot faster than pnmconvol the upshot all this that cjpeg quality smooth probably good starting point for converting gifs but you really care about the image you want check the results and maybe try few other

ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set booby traps for israeli patrols every time israeli soldier killed injured these traps israel retalliates indiscriminately bombing villages their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians this tried and true method utilized guerilla and terrorists groups conduct operations the midst the local populace thus forcing the opposing state possible harm innocent civilians their search order avoid the deaths civilians abandon the search certainly the people who use the population for cover are also blaim for dragging the innocent civilians into harm way are you suggesting that when guerillas use the population for cover israel should totally back down the easiest way get away with attacking another use innocent shield and hope that the other respects innocent lives tell tim what are these guerillas doing wrong assuming that they are using civilians for cover are they not killing soldiers their country the buffer zone prevent attacks israel not working why further neccessary for israeli guns pound lebanese villages why not just kill those who try infiltrate the buffer zone you see there more the shelling the villages called retaliation getting back getting even doesn make sense shell the villages the least shows reckless disregard the israeli government for the lives civilians israel insists that the called security zone necessary for the protection northern israel than will have pay the price its occupation with the blood its soldiers israel interested peace than should withdraw from our land what the whole bit about attacks israel from neighboring arab states can start all over again while also hope for this happen will only occur when arab states show that they are prepared take the responsibility and the duty stop guerilla attacks israel from their soil they have prove provide some guaratees there way israel going accept their word not with their past attitude tolerance towards anti israel guerillas residence israel not willing accept the word others then imho has business wasting others time coming the peace talks have written before this very newsgroup that the only real solution will come result comprehensive peace settlement whereby israel withdraws its own borders and peace keeping troops are stationed along the border insure one either side the border shelled good lord brad not basil think basil very intelligent person and respect what writes basil person that would gladly call friend however not nor lebanese some seem suspect this the only realistic solution time for israel realize that the concept buffer zone aimed protecting its northern cities has failed fact has caused much more israeli deaths than the occasional shelling northern israel would have resulted perhaps you are aware that most communities people there the feeling that better that many die fighting against those who attack than for few die while silently accept our fate however you call israel see the sense suffering fewer casualties suggest you apply the same palestinian arab and islamic groups tim you are ignoring the fact that the palestinians lebanon have been disarmed hezbollah remains the only independent militia hezbollah does not attack israel except few times such when the idf burned sheikh mosavi his wife and young son course israel would withdraw from lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn make the lebanese mad that furthermore with hezbollah subsequently disarmed would not possible and now the lebanese government has proven that capable controlling and disarming all militias they did all other parts lebanon basil has not without the support and active involvement syria lebanon would not have been able accomplish all that has occurred once syria leaves who say that lebanon will able retain control syria stays thay may even more dangerous for israel tim when the last time that you recall any trouble the syrian border not lately israel knows very well that the syrians are able restrain all who would use territory under their control attack israel while lebanon would better off with syria and israel out its borders the presence syrian troops lebanon has meant sharp decrease attacks israeli territory not israeli troops lebanon however please note the distinction the past two years tim your view this entire matter far too serenely one sided and selectively naive disagree basil has always seemed cool headed person slow anger certainly more than what most important that actual witness things from

solntze wpd sgi com jon livesey writes much though might fun debate capital punishment itself this probably the wrong group for the only relevance here that you don seem able tell what capital punishment actually and when murder that when you tell murder wrong you are using term you have not yet defined well said that when innocent person has been executed this objectively murder however who blame another question seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts executions realizing the risks blame there probability killing innocent person shooting random into the air and there probability killing innocent person when the state administers system capital punishment when you either you know that they actions you are taking will sooner later result the killing innocent person yes but there also probablity that you will kill someone doing any raondom activity presumably you had not isolated yourself totally from the rest society because this and driving will kill people will airlines but people continue both driving and flying are not punishments inflicted unwilling prisoners courts they are risks that take upon ourselves willingly and argue that our law system similar risk perhaps innocent person will punished someday but work prevent this fact many criminals free result our trying prevent punishment innocents our own driving kills someone else then sure there moral issue know least one person who was involved fatal accident and they felt vey guilty afterwards but such accidents are totally expected given the numner vehicals the road again the blame society not this what you said you were saying that there were such false witness that resulted innocent person being convicted and killed would still the fault the state since did the actual killing just commented that the state does the killing does not depend there being false witnesses how could the state does the killing even the case sincere mistakes yes but the state not fault such case the state can only much prevent false witnesses possible what are you trying say that capital punishment always murder because the possibilty human error invalidating the system saying capital punishment murder period not because this that and the other but because involves taking human life that definition murder make appeals dictionaries objective morals okay this what you call murder but the question whether not all such murders are wrong are you saying that all taking human life wrong matter what the circumstances society decide murder someone then should say that and lists our reasons for doing and live with the moral consequences should not play word games and pretend that murder isn murder and that opinion about how society ought run but this basically how works society accepts the risk that innocent person will murdered execution and every member society shares this blame and most people definitions murder include some sort malicious intent which not involved execution but were trying discuss objective moral system least its possibilty what ramifications does your personal system have objective one were not discussing objective moral system was showing you that you didn have one because for one thing you were incapable defining the terms for example murder murder violates the golden rule executions not because allowing all society implicitly accepts the consequences matter who the innocent victim not talking about reading minds are just talking about knowing the truth yes can never absolutely certain that have the truth but the court systems work principle knowing the truth beyond reasonable doubt sorry but you simply are not quoting yourself accurately here what you said and since are looking totally objectively this case then know what people are thinking when they are voting execute the person not the intent malicious and unfair then the execution would murder what you are doing now slide into another claim which quite different the jury being persuaded beyond serious doubt not the same knowing what their minds beyond serious doubt reading the minds the jury would certainly tell whether not conviction was moral not but objective system only the absolute truth matters and the jury system one method approximate such truth that twelve members must convinced truth moreover jury which comes from sufficiently prejudiced background may allow itself persuaded beyond serious doubt evidence that you and would laugh but then read the minds these people would know that the conviction was unfair but would perfectly fair could read minds assume that would fair knew the absolute truth why much less fair your opinion only have good approximation the absolute truth not question fairness your claim which have quoted above claim about whether can know was fair able distinguish capital punishnment from murder yes while could objectively determine the difference knew all possible information can always determine the difference our flawed system think that our system almost good possible but still isn objectively perfect you see doesn matter know fair not objectively either fair not now there huge difference can read minds can know and cannot read minds can know nothing the difference not degree fairness but what can know but what know has effect objective system think possible produce fairly objective system are clear which goals supposed promote not going waste time trying devise system that pretty sure does not exist why are you sure simply want people confront reality reality remember why your reality important this case the reality that ideal theories apart can never know even after the fact about the fairness the justice system for every innocent person released from death row there may have been dozen innocent people executed hundred none all simply don know but can assume that the system fairly decent least most likely and you realize that the correctness our system says nothing about totally ideal and objective system now what are going the one hand can pretend that have ideal theory and that can know things can never know and the justie system fair and that can wave magic wand and make certain types killing not murder and our way well can have ideal system but the working system can not ideal can only hope create system that close approximation the ideal system possible the other hand can recognize that all justice has small hope probability punishing the innocent and that the end bear moral responsibility even for the probabilistic consequences the systems set and then say well here murdering again maybe some will even say gee wonder all this strictly necessary yes all bear the responsibility most people seem willing this think that the second preferable that requires people face the moral consequences what society instead sheltering ourselves from them magic ceremonies and word games must realize the consequences all our actions why you keep separating the justice system from the pack and lest forget also don think have objective moral system and believe only have take that idea seriously when someone presents evidence don think our country has objective system but think such objective system can exist theory without omniscience objective system not possible practice keith

 |text from dlecoint garnet acns fsu edu darius_lecointe subject sabbath admissions 5of5 organization florida state university lines 227 someone sent this faq mail and post response here not enforcing the inclusion limits this faq because most our readers probably haven seen clh christ warns that anyone who breaks one the least these commandments and teaches otheres the same will called least the kingdom heaven matt this faq full error that must respond hope that whoever maintains will remove from the partisan theology brothers and sisters being new the faith and examining the decalogue closely noticed the fourth commandment pretty specific about keeping the sabbath day states the 7th day saturday the sabbath while most christian religions keep atleast church sunday what this frequently asked question every time arises causes months debate let see can answer you directly basically because the law was given moses part specific covenanent with the jews most aren jews aren part that covenant there was argument early christian history about whether the mosaic laws should apply gentiles who became christians you can see the account this debate acts the main question there was circumcision but keeping the sabbath would part well the apostles concluded that need not become jews order become christians and therefore that rules such circumcision did not apply the law was known man before was revealed mount sinai rom notes that where law there transgression not only did sin exist before sinai eden but the sabbath was kept before was revealed sinai the problem with the first covenant was not the law but the promise which undergirded god wanted perform his will the lives the people but their ignorance after 400 years slavery they promised what ever says will that why the new covenant based better promises heb rather than away with the law god promised put laws their minds and write them their hearts heb including the sabbath the acts selective inclusion the sabbath was more important the jews than circumcision any attempt had been made away with the sabbath the reaction would have been even more strident than recorded acts not confuse the weekly sabbath the decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur any time the week and were part the law ceremonial which was added because transgression the moral law gal israel stands for god people all time that why god grafted the gentiles roma says that the adoption the glory the covenants the giving the law the service god and the promises belong israelites explanation paul makes clear that being born into israel not enough for they are not all israel which are israel then gal says christ then are abraham seed and heirs according the promise all christians are abraham seed jews israelites not physically for that not the criterion but spiritually are joint heirs with jesus based the promise god made all his people the israelites while christians agree that the laws not all apply because some them are part specific covenanent with the jews also expect see some similarity between the things god expected from the jews and the things expects from after all the same god however there are several ways dealing with this these days the most common approach separate the commandments into moral and ceremonial ceremonial commandments apply only the jews they are part the specific mosaic covenant these are thinsg like the kosher laws and circumcision moral laws apply everyone most the commands are part the moral law except for the commandment about the sabbath believe most people who take this approach would say that the specific requirement worship the sabbath part the ceremonial law but general obligation worship regularly part the general moral law thus christians are free choose the specific time worship people would probably agree but they are wrong how can the sabbath commandment ceremonial when part law which predates the ceremonial laws you are not free choose your time worship even you were why you follow day worship which has its origins pagan sun worship would you rather give day which god blessed sanctified and hallowed exchange for one which all church leaders agree has not biblical foundation see sabbath admissions soc religion christian bible study more radical approach which generally connected with john calvin and the reformed tradition says that the law whole longer binding instead are entirely under grace and our behavior should guided solely love portions the law are still useful guidance but they are not properly speaking legally binding practice most people who take this position not believe safe leave christians without moral guidannce while may longer under law sinners not safe for into situations with principles guide too good self justification for that safe thus christians have moral guidance from things like jesus teachings paul advice etc these may not precisely law but they serve much the same function and have largely the same content the moral law the previous analysis while calvin would deny that have fixed legal responsibility worship any specific day would say that given human weakness the discipline regular worship important not care what calvin any theologian says guide what god says being not under the law means not have keep the law why that the only section the law have trouble with the sabbath commandment which the only one god thought was important enough say remember you study the word deeply you will note that the message that are longer under the condemnation the law but freed the grace god cop pulls over for speeding then court ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book but gives grace walk out the court saying can now speeding for now under grace being under grace now drive within the speed limit paul adds rom then make void the law through faith god forbid yea establish the law wherefore the law holy and the commandment holy and just and good rom both analyses the specific day not issue matter tradition worship sunday memorial christ resurrection there some debate about what acts shows about early christian worship the most common analysis that shows jewish christians continuing jewish services the sabbath but that specifically christian service were not necessarily held then act shows worship the first day sunday and cor also implies gatherings that day there are few groups that continue believe christians have worship the sabbath saturday the best known are the seventh day adventists and jehovah witnesses they argue that act not regular worship service but special meeting see paul off and that cor doesn explicitly say regular worship service you prefer implication fact careful study the acts shows that the meeting was saturday night and that sunday morning paul did not worship service but set off long journey foot assos icor there way you can equate lay him store with worship service clear that this issue was contested one paul time see rom paul advice that should very careful about judging each other issues like this one person sees specific day mandated god while another does not who observes that specific day does honor the lord who believes his worship free such restrictions also does honor the lord those who believe that the sabbath still mandated argue that paul not referring sabbath worship here note however col which says something similar but briefer explicitly mentions sabbath wrong these are the sabbath days the ceremonial law not the sabbath day the moral law there are some differences among christians about use the word sabbath originally the term referred the 7th day the jewish day worship many christians now use refer sunday the day christian worship they this largely that they can apply the 4th whatever there are couple different numbering schemes commandment reformed tradition does not this distinguishes between the sabbath which the observance mandated for jews and the lord day which the free christian worship the only reference can find this the rev there are also differences about laws regarding this day many christians support blue laws both secular law and church law setting aside that day and causing people spend worship the more radical anti legal approach sees such regulations return the jewish sabbath which not appropriate the free christian worship the lord day why would you prefer twist and turn relying different arguments which conflict with each other rather than obey simple request from god who loved you enough die for you jesus died because the law could not changed why bother die order meet the demands broken law all you need change the law penalties for law breaking means the law immutable that why sin not follow the demands the ceremonial laws will always sin make false gods violate god name break the sabbath steal kill etc except you disagree but then your opinion has weight when placed next the word god darius not clear how much more needs said other than the faq think paul comments esteeming one day over another rom probably all that needs said accept that darius doing what does honor the lord just wish might equally accept that those who esteem all days alike are similarly doing their best honor the lord however like clear that not think there unambiguous proof that regular christian worship was the first day indicated there are responses both the passages cited the difficulty with both these passages that they are actually about something else they both look like they are talking about nnregular christian meetings but neither explicitly says and they gathered every sunday for worship get various pieces information but nothing aimed answering this question act describes christians participating both jewish temple worship and christian communion services homes obviously the temple worship the sabbath acts example christians participating them unfortunately doesn tell what day christians met their houses acts despite darius confusion described acts occuring sunday see reason impose modern definitions when days start when the biblical text clear about what was meant the wording implies that this was normal meeting doesn say they gathered see paul off but that when they were gathered for breaking bread paul talked about his upcoming travel but that just not explicit enough really convincing similarly with cor says that the first day they should set aside money for paul collection now you want believe that they gathered specially this that they did their homes can disprove but the obvious time for congregation take offering would when they normally gather for worship and they were expected their homes there would reason mention specific day think the most obvious reading this that the first day every week simply means every time they gather for worship think the reason have only implications and not clear statements that the authors assumed that their readers knew when christian worship was clh

version archive name ripem attacks last update mar 0500 some possible attacks ripem this living list potential weaknesses keep your eyes open for when using ripem for secure electronic mail does not into great detail and almost certainly not exhaustive obviously many the weaknesses are weaknesses cryptographically secured mail general and will pertain secure mail programs other than ripem maintained marc vanheyningen mvanheyn indiana edu posted monthly variety news groups followups pertaining specifically ripem should alt security ripem cryptanalysis attacks breaking rsa would allow attacker find out your private key which case could read any mail encrypted you and sign messages with your private key rsa generally believed resistant all standard cryptanalytic techniques even standard key about 516 bits with ripem long enough render this impractical barring huge investment hardware breakthrough factoring breaking des would allow attacker read any given message since the message itself encrypted with des would not allow attacker claim you des has only bits its key and thus could conceivably compromised brute force with sufficient hardware but few agencies have such money devote simply read one message since each message has different des key the work for each message would remain high key management attacks stealing your private key would allow the same benefits breaking rsa safeguard encrypted with des key which derived from passphrase you type however attacker can get copy your private keyfile and your passphrase snooping network packets tapping lines whatever could break the whole scheme the main risk that transferring either the passphrase the private key file across untrusted link don that run ripem trusted machine preferably one sitting right front you ideally your own machine your own home maybe office which nobody else has physical access fooling you into accepting bogus public key for someone else could allow opponent deceive you into sending secret messages him rather than the real recipient the enemy can fool your intended recipient well could encrypt the messages with the other bogus public key and pass them along important get the proper public keys other people the most common mechanism for this finger assuming the opponent has not compromised routers daemons such finger can given fair amount trust the strongest method key authentication exchange keys person however this not always practical having other people vouch for you signing statement containing your key possible although ripem doesn have features for doing this automatically pgp ripem does generate and check md5 fingerprints public keys the key files they may exchanged via separate channel for authentication playback attacks even opponent cannot break the cryptography opponent could still cause difficulties for example suppose you send message with mic only pem mode which does not provide disclosure protection alice which says let that your opponent intercepts and now resends bob who now has message which authenticated from you telling him that course may interpret entirely different context your opponent could transmit the same message the same recipient much later figuring would seen differently later time the opponent could change the originator name himself register your public key his and send message hoping the recipient will send him return mail indicating perhaps even quoting the unknown message defeat playback attacks the plaintext each message should include some indication the sender and recipient and unique identifier typically the date good front end script for ripem should this automatically imho recipient you should sure that the originator name header and the sender indicated within the plaintext are the same that you really are recipient and that the message not old one some this also can and should automated the author this faq has made modest attempt automating the process generating and checking encapsulated headers the programs are included the standard distribution the utils directory local attacks clearly the security ripem cannot greater than the security the machine where the encryption performed for example under unix super user could manage get your encrypted mail although would take some planning and effort something like replace the ripem executable with trojan horse get copy the plaintext depending how stored addition the link between you and the machine running ripem extension that you decrypt with ripem remote machine which you are connected via network worse yet modem eavesdropper could see the plaintext and probably also your passphrase ripem should only executed systems you trust obviously the extreme case ripem should only used your own machine which you have total control over and which nobody else has access which has only carefully examined software known free viruses and however there very real trade off between convenience and security here more moderately cautious user might use ripem unix workstation where other people have access even root access but increase security keeping private keys and the statically linked course executable floppy disk some people will keep ripem multi user system but when dialing over insecure line they will download the message their own system and perform the ripem decryption there however the security provided such mechanism somewhat illusory since you presumably type your cleartext password log you just given away the store since the attacker can now log you and install traps your account steal your private key next time you use from less insecure line this will likely remain the situation long most systems use the rather quaint mechanism cleartext password authentication find nice put brief statement how carefully manage security arrangement plan next public key that potential correspondents can aware what level precautions are place some people use two keys short one which not carefully managed for ordinary use and longer one which treated with greater care for critical correspondence untrusted partner attacks ripem encryption will ensure that only person with the private key corresponding the public key used encrypt the data may read the traffic however once someone with that key gets the message she may always make whatever kind transformations she wishes there exist cryptographic barriers recipient say taking encrypted message and converting mic only message signed you and readable anyone although ripem does not provide this functionality indeed the latest pem draft have seen specifically states that such transformations should possible allow forwarding functions work including the recipients the plaintext mentioned above will make possible for recipients redistributed message aware its original nature naturally the security the cryptography can never greater than the security the people using

available ria ccs uwo pub xget_selection tar which can adapted this subject how does use environment variables loading resources you can use several environment variables control how resources are loaded for your based programs xfilesearchpath xuserfilesearchpath and xapplresdir these environment variables control where looks for application defaults files application initializing loads most one app defaults file from the path defined xfilesearchpath and another from the path defined xuserfilesearchpath set xfilesearchpath software installed your system such way that app defaults files appear several different directory hierarchies suppose for example that you are running sun open windows and you also have some applications installed usr lib x11 app defaults you could set value like this for xfilesearchpath and would cause look app defaults files both usr lib x11 and usr openwin lib wherever your openwinhome located setenv xfilesearchpath usr lib x11 openwinhome lib the value this environment variable colon separated list pathnames the pathnames contain replacement characters follows see xtresolvepathname the value the filename parameter the application class name the value the file type this case the literal string app defaults customization resource only suffix none for app defaults language locale and codeset ja_jp euc language part the territory part the display language string the codeset part the display language string let take apart the example suppose the application class name myterm also suppose open windows installed usr openwin notice the example omits locale specific lookup usr lib x11 means usr lib x11 app defaults myterm openwinhome lib means usr openwin lib app defaults myterm the application initializes tries open both the above app defaults files the order shown soon finds one reads and uses and stops looking for others the effect this path search first usr lib x11 then usr openwin let consider another example this time let set xuserfilesearchpath looks for the file myterm the current working directory then for myterm the directory app defaults setenv xuserfilesearchpath home app defaults the first path the list expands myterm the second expands home app defaults myterm this convenient setting for debugging because follows the imake convention naming the app defaults file myterm the application source directory you can run the application from the directory which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly note when looking for app default files with xuserfilesearchpath for some bizarre reason neither the type nor file suffix defined and are useless with there another twist you may specify customization resource value for example you might run the myterm application like this myterm xrm customization color one your pathname specifications had the value usr lib x11 then the expanded pathname would usr lib x11 app defaults myterm color because the substitution character takes the value the customization resource the default xfilesearchpath compiled into usr lib x11 usr lib x11 usr lib x11 usr lib x11 usr lib x11 usr lib x11 note some sites replace usr lib x11 with projectroot this batch default settings the default xuserfilesearchpath also compiled into root root root root root root root either the value xapplresdir the user home directory xapplresdir not set you set xuserfilesearchpath some value other than the default ignores xapplresdir altogether notice that the quick and dirty way making your application find your app defaults file your current working directory set xapplresdir single dot all this machinery worked differently for compatibilty many people set their xapplresdir value dot followed slash thanks oliver jones world std com subject how have the xdm put picture behind the log window the answer lies changing xdm xrdb resource the xdm config file run program change the background before loading the resources for example your usr lib x11 xdm xdm config file may add the line displaymanager authorize false permit unrestricted access the display before log beware and also displaymanager xrdb usr lib x11 xdm new xrdb where that file does something for all connections along the lines bin comes with arguments display load usr lib x11 xdm xresources usr bin x11 xsetroot display bitmap usr lib x11 xdm new bitmap usr bin x11 xrdb substitute xloadimage for xsetroot taste note that this general hack that can used invoke console window any other client thanks jay bourland jayb cauchy stanford edu subject why isn path set when xdm runs xsession file when xdm runs your xsession doesn source your cshrc login files you can set the path explicitly you normally could for any script you can place all environment setting statements separate file and source from both the xsession file and your shell configuration file you set your path your cshrc file the normal place you can make your xsession have path set simply making csh

core gravity this paper both describes how heavenly bodys can stationary ether sucking structures and why observe orbital motion ether the theoretical propogation media electro magnetic waves was concluded not exist based the results the michelson moreley experiment conducted century ago propose that those conclusions are flawed based the fact that the experiment was designed look for flow parallel the earth surface not perpindicular due the prevailing assumption that the earth traveled through the ether ball through the wind the reversal the that conclusion pivotal keystone the development modern scientific thought could have ramifications biblical proportions through out the world remember einstien said imagination greater than knowledge dream like this ether based reality the ether like fluid out phase with our reality creations start lattice placed into the ether given spin the lattices both drag the fluid like margarita blender and ingest converting distilling localized mass time and energy non spinning lattice dark matter the earth isn exactly spinning around the sun picture image galaxy haven any videos them spinning picture being stationary and the sun image being dragged across the sky the spinning ether field picture onion each layer which spinning little faster than the next thread shot the inner kernel would stretched diagonally sideways its head being faster shell than its tail until finally intersected the ground the inner kernel its direction vector being straight down but its foot print being line not point sunrise sunset the moon isn exactly orbiting parasite non self spin sustaining being dragged the earth ether field which itself the sun much more powerful field our seasons are the wobble earth axis like top slowing down the orbit the earth around the sun all the stars images being dragged around the sun ether feild the earth moon and sun are about the same size and distance apart its just that the time between them varies greatly because the path not the same the moon lattice the ether like sticking fork plate spaghetti and giving the plate half turn the sun lattice has much spin that its like the fork has got the whole plate noodles wound the piece light going the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make hook the end the piece light going the sun has around the whole plate like needle record before gets there with pencil compass and rule draw diagram how the moon can about big earth shadow upon and other times totally eclipse the sun look the sky except for your knowledge would you guess that they are about the same size just because they look about the same size the full moon quarter moon etc the difference between rate ether spins what are looking rotating turntable view the moon only half which facing the sun seen half moon within about 120 degrees sky the sun during the day try and draw that earth shadow its only the moon image which appears orbit matter where the light part the part facing the sun and the dark part the half facing away from the sun even when appears behind light years between galaxies misnomer the distance closer zero time and matter are characteristics this phase reality which dissipates outward with each layer the onion defining edge ether spin what are seeing could essentially happening now the piece light may have experienced many years but the trip could very quick our time time travel warp space might consider learning spin myself phase out mass good luck trying design propulsion system drag around space time locality its like trying move

ability authorized officials access telephone calls and data under proper court other legal order when necessary protect our citizens the effective and timely use the most modern technology build the national information infrastructure needed promote economic growth and the competitiveness american industry the global marketplace and the need companies manufacture and export high technology products the president has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries the congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights individuals policy options are developed the administration committed working with the private sector spur the development national information infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies give americans unprecedented access information this infrastructure high speed networks information superhighways will transmit video images hdtv programming and huge data files easily today telephone system transmits voice since encryption technology will play increasingly important role that infrastructure the federal government must act quickly develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use the administration committed policies that protect all americans right privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law further information provided accompanying fact sheet the provisions the president directive acquire the new encryption technology are also available for additional details call mat heyman national institute standards and technology 301 975 2758 questions and answers about the clinton administration telecommunications initiative does this approach expand the authority government agencies listen phone conversations clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with new authorities access the content the private conversations americans suppose law enforcement agency conducting wiretap drug smuggling ring and intercepts conversation encrypted using the device what would they have decipher the message they would have obtain legal authorization normally court order the wiretap the first place they would then present documentation this authorization the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used the drug smugglers the key split into two parts which are stored separately order ensure the security the key escrow system who will run the key escrow data banks the two key escrow data banks will run two independent entities this point the department justice and the administration have yet determine which agencies will oversee the key escrow data banks how strong the security the device how can sure how strong the security this system more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today while the algorithm will remain classified protect the security the key escrow system are willing invite independent panel cryptography experts evaluate the algorithm assure all potential users that there are unrecognized vulnerabilities whose decision was propose this product the national security council the justice department the commerce department and other key agencies were involved this decision this approach has been endorsed the president the vice president and appropriate cabinet officials who was consulted the congress industry have going discussions with congress and industry encryption issues and expect those discussions intensify carry out our review encryption policy have briefed members congress and industry leaders the decisions related this initiative will the government provide the hardware manufacturers the government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but not providing the microcircuits product manufacturers product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them who provides the clipper chip mykotronx programs their facility torrance california and will sell the chip encryption device manufacturers the programming function could licensed other vendors the future how buy one these encryption devices expect several manufacturers consider incorporating the clipper chip into their devices the administration were unable find technological solution like the one proposed would the administration willing use legal remedies restrict access more powerful encryption devices this fundamental policy question which will considered during the broad policy review the key escrow mechanism will provide americans with encryption product that more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but just one piece what must the comprehensive approach encryption technology which the administration developing the administration not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement will prohibit outright some countries have effectively done nor the saying that every american matter right entitled unbreakable commercial encryption product there false tension created the assessment that this issue either proposition rather both concerns can and fact are harmoniously balanced through reasoned balanced approach such proposed with the clipper chip and similar encryption techniques what does this decision indicate about how the clinton administration policy toward encryption will differ from that the bush administration indicates that understand the importance encryption technology telecommunications and computing and are committed working with industry and public interest groups find innovative ways protect americans privacy help businesses compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need fight crime and terrorism will the devices exportable will other devices that use the government hardware voice encryption devices are subject export control requirements case case review for each export required ensure appropriate use these devices the same true for other encryption devices one the attractions this technology the protection can give companies operating home and abroad with this mind expect export licenses will granted case case basis for companies seeking use these devices secure their own communications abroad plan review the possibility permitting wider exportability these products

explaination however you left off one detail why you always see them nuclear plants but not always fossil fuel plants nuclear plants prefered run the water closed cycle whereas fossil fuel plants can some cases get away with dumping the hot water recall the water isn hot thermodynamically many fossil fuel plants and course there less danger radioactive contamination actually the reasons you don see many cooling towers fossil plants are fossil units multiple units per plant are generally smaller than nuclear plants 300 mwe seemed very popular size when many fossil plants were built the average nuclear plant 1000 mwe many fossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were adopted why those old dirt burners can harm anything let powered draft cooling towers low enough the ground generally not visible from off site are quite popular with fossil plants fossil plants used get much less regulatory attention than nuclears actually fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual boiling water reactor nuclear plants there gripe the industry that nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology more important nuclear plants get the cold end the system cold possible hence big cooling towers oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers but they usually are sized get the steam back into hot water not most the way down ambient some plants cool the condensers with water rather than air one canadian official asked about thermal pollution icing river said here view heat resource actually the condensing environment essentially the same for plants similar size the issues are the same regardless where the heat comes from condensers are run high vacuum possible order reduce aerodynamic drag the turbine the condenser pressure normally water vapor pressure the condensing temperature desirable that the steam exhaust free water droplets because moisture the steam causes severe erosion damage the turbine low pressure blades and because entrained water moving high velocity causes erosion the condenser tubes the coldest and thus lowest pressure condensing environment always the best related issue that pumping the condensate from the hotwell where the water ends after dripping off the condenser tubes since the condenser very low pressure the only force driving the condensate into the hotwell pumps gravity the condensate too hot the gravity head too low the condensate will reflash into steam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps cavitate this particularly destructive form cavitation that avoided all costs the hotwell pumps are located the lowest point the plant order provide gravity head the pumps how much lower they must function how hot the water allowed get the hotwell typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120 degrees depending the temperature the river water this term used describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower system operating closed loop mode and essentially river water pumped when the river water temperature high the summer operators will typically allow the hotwell level rise order provide more gravity head there tradeoff involved since higher hotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the condenser area least the east and elsewhere where moisture actually exists the air the river water will almost always cooler than the discharge water from the cooling towers the temperature the discharge water from the cooling towers set the ambient air temperature and humidity very rare the east hear actual river water temperatures exceeding degrees vast difference from the typical days degrees humidity see routinely the east not unusual particularly where the econazis have been successful clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits plant for the plant have reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets too high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive pressure everybody runs closed cycle boilers the water used purified solids which otherwise crud the boiler plumbing when the water boils purifying water for boiler use bigger job than cooling the boiler water recycled true actually secondary plant the part

israel has repeatedly stated that will leave lebanon when the lebanese government can provide guarantees that israel will not attacked from lebanese soil and when the syrians leave not acceptable syria and lebanon have right determine they wish return the situation prior the french invasion where they were both part the same mandate territory read colony israel has right determine what happens lebanon invading another country because you consider them threat precisely the way that almost all wars aggression have started israel occupation the west bank gaza and golan temporary the three are very different issues israel has stated repeatedly that will not give the whole golan but may willing give part syria part peace agreement again territorial expansion force israel has already annexed areas taken over the 1967 war these areas are not occupied but disputed since there legitamate governing body citizenship was given those residents annexed areas who wanted citizenship the defines them occupied they are recognised such every nation earth excluding one small caribean island israel should keep control parts the west bank imho the parts that should kept are the westernmost mountain ridge which contain few arab towns and many suburbs well overlooking the city tel aviv the eastern mountain ridge should abandonded this where most the arabs live and less militarily relevant israel should also maintain presence the jordan valley the adam thinks that peace possible with continued occupation and continued military presence that completely unsustainable situation because the usa bankrupt and simply cannot afford finance the israeli ecconomy any more there money for such occupation for those you who support why were many settlers moved into the territories not temporary let hear there are number reasons for people move they were not moved but chose move into disputed areas note that since these moves were made free willed human beings not settlers will address two aspects your question why the government would allow encourage them move and second why they did move they were moved part deliberate policy prevent the return the occupied territories machiavelli described the reasoning the prince the clear intention was create constituency which the likud beleived could not deprived the land stolen from the indigenous population the pretexts under which the settlers aquired land was through the redefinition much land used common public land the assertion that the village common which the village depends for food belongs invader simply because individual has title clearly excuse when the land used build condominium for aliens brought occupy the land for foreign power there clear breach the geneva convention which stipulates that land use occupied territories must not changed amount self justifying the part likud and hard linner appologists will change the fact that the majority world governments and all those that actually have any power have condemned this practice the government had number reasons for encouraging people move across the green line they included security and politics the first reason was security large jewish presense makes difficult for terrorists infiltrate jewish settlements also act fortresses times war theyu also are liability are talking about civilian encampments that would last more than hours against tanks second reason was political creating settlements brought the arabs the negotiation table had the creation new towns and cities gone another several years there would place left israel where there was arab majority there would have been land left that could called arab don fool yourself was the gulf war that brought the israelis the negotiating table once their backers had secure base the gulf they insrtructed shamir negotiate else the creation settlements had gone any longer the usa would have cut the money supply the fact that there are hundered thousands jews place changes the face any peace settlement and restricts what land can given away not all they can chose live arab state return israel some the communites created were religious they built their neighborhoods areas where there were jews until the riots the and there are communities like this hebron gaza and all over there are also communities built near religious sites the existence comunity does not give the right for another country annexe territory not bosnia not the west bank the point there are many reasons people moved over the green line and many reasons the government wanted them whatever status negotiated for disputed territories will not all nothing deal new boundaries will drawn negotiation not the results war unless the new boundaries drawn are those there will peace araffat has precious little authority agree anything else the real issue not the land treaty but the trade treaty since the palestinians will remain heavily dependent israel indefinitely this that will the guarantor peace another factor will the return lands confiscated the israeli state within israel and the dismantling the shadow structures which allow discrimination against non jews within what nominaly secular state the irony that return for guarantee that the palestinian state has non descrimination law order protect the remaining settlers the israeli state going forced inot the same position this will mean outlawing discrimination such that which prevents arabs from buying using much the land phill hallam baker

features this point most respondents have agreed upon twm the best candidate for speedy window manager couple generic tricks you can try soup your window manger turning off unnecessary things like zooming and opaque move also you lay out your windows tiled manner you reduce the amount cpu power spent raising and lowering overlapping windows joe english joe trystero art com found that good font for tiling 7x13 aka misc fixed medium normal 100 100 100 iso8859 the biggest font know that can use sun 1152x900 screen and still get two column terminal windows side side the display with overlap other font suggestions will accepted the server which server make sure that your server proper match for your hardware you have monochrome monitor use monochrome x11 server monochrome sun haven noticed much difference between the xsun colour server and xsunmono however was pointed out that xsunmono about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute less paging thanks jonny farringdon farringdon psychol ucl michael salmon michael salmon eos ericsson how your server was compiled can also make difference jeff law law schirf utah edu advises that sun system should compiled with gcc version with the unbundled sun compiler you can expect get very large speedups the server not using the bundled sunos compiler assume that similar results would occur you used one the other high quality commercial compilers the market locking the server into ram has anyone tried hacking the server that locked into ram and does not get paged via call plock does this help performance all had one inquiry this topic and few pointers the plock function call but hard evidence from someone who tried not position give try thanks eric claeys ecc eperm att com danny backx sunbim juan martin juando cnm starting your server joe english joe trystero art com you start lot clients your xsession whatever sleep for second two after launching each one after changed xclients script this logging actually took less time have heavily loaded system without much core though this sounds crazy but have confirmed that works warner losh imp solbourne com provided with good explanation why this works which have summarized here when you start server takes huge amount time start accepting connections lot initialization done the server when starts this process touches large number pages any other process running the same time would fight the server for use the cpu and more importantly memory you put sleep there you give the server chance get itself sorted out before the clients start similarly there also lot initialization whenever client program starts toolkits registering widgets resources being fetched programs initializing state and databases and forth all this activity typically memory intensive once this initialization done the process has reached steady state the memory usage typically settles down using only few pages using sleeps stagger the launching your clients your xinitrc you avoid them fighting each other for your workstation limited resources this most definitely your mileage may vary situation there are many variables considered available ram local swap space load average number users your system which clients you are starting etc currently xinitrc have situation like sleep exec xclock sleep exec xbiff sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm experimented with sleep exec xclock sleep exec xbiff sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm even tried sleep exec start_x_clients_script and then start_x_clients_script had sleep exec xclock sleep exec xbiff sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm the idea with this last one was make sure that xinit had completely finished processing xinitrc and had settled down into steady state before the sleep expired and all clients were launched all these yielded fairly comparable results and just stuck with current setup for its simplicity you will probably have experiment bit find setup which suits you fonts loading fonts takes time and ram you minimize the number fonts your applications use you get speed increases load time one simple strategy choose small number fonts one small one large one roman whatever suits you and configure all your clients least all your heavily used clients use only those few fonts client programs should start quicker their font already loaded into the server this will also conserve server resources since fewer fonts will loaded the server farrell mckay fbm ptcburp ptcbu joe english joe trystero art com main xterm font 7x13 also have twm set use 7x13 all menus and icons etc twm default font 8x13 since don normally use 8x13 eliminated one font from server oliver jones roadrunner pictel com keep fonts local the workstation rather than loading them over nfs you will make extensive use scalable fonts use font server about the resources file keep your xresources xdefaults file small saves ram and saves server startup time joe english joe trystero art com one suggestion your xdefaults xresources file try putting only the minimum number resources that you want have available all your applications for example reversevideo true then separate your resources into individual client specific resource files for example home lib app defaults your login file set the environment variable xuserfilesearchpath setenv xuserfilesearchpath home lib app defaults the comp windows frequently asked questions faq contains excellent explanation how these environment variables work when xterm launches loads its resources from app defaults xterm xdvi finds them app defaults xdvi and and forth note that not all clients follow the same xxxxx resource file naming pattern you can check your system app defaults directory often usr x11r5 lib x11 app defaults find the proper name and then name your personal resource files with the same name this all documented the specification 125 666 thanks kevin samborn samborn mtkgc com michael urban urban cobra jpl nasa gov and mike long mikel cornell edu kevin willing mail his setup files inquirers this method organizing your personal resources has the following benefits easier maintain more usable fewer resources are stored the server the resource_manager property side benefit your server may start fractionally quicker since doesn have load all your resources applications only process their own resources never have sort through all your resources find the ones that affect them also has drawbacks the application that you are interested has load additional file every time starts this doesn seem make that much performance difference and you might consider this huge boon usability you are modifying application resource database you just need run the application without having xrdb again xrdb will default run your xdefaults file through cpp when your resources are split out into multiple resource files and then loaded the individual client programs they will not watch out for this had style comments xdefaults file which cpp stripped out when switched this method distributed resource files spent several frustrating days trying figure out why clients were not finding their resources did not provide any error message when encountered the style comments the resource files simply silently aborted processing the resource file the loss preprocessing which can very handy ifdef color enough cause some people dismiss this method resource management you may also run into some clients which break the rules for example neither emacs nor xvt will find their resources they are anywhere other than xdefaults when starting client machine that does not share files with the machine where your resources are stored your client will not find its resources loading all your resources into the server will guarantee that all your clients will always find their resources casey leedom casey gauss llnl gov possible compromise suggestion that have and planning trying put resources for all heavily used clients xterm into xdefaults file and use the separate resources files method for clients that seldom use define your display properly client programs are often executed the same machine the server that situation rather than setting your display environment variable hostname where hostname the name your workstation you should set your display variable unix doing this you access optimized routines that know that the server the same machine and use shared memory method transferring requests thanks patrick horgan pjh70 ras amdahl com see the _display names_ section the man page for further explanation how properly set your display name don think stock mit but least data general and have libraries that are smart enough use local communication even when the display isn set specially rob sartin 88opensi sartin uunet net jody goldberg jody algorithmics com sent xlib patch change stock use local communication even display not properly set don want get the business distributing trying juggle non mit patches and have elected not include here hopefully mit will apply this minor lines patch themselves the meantime you want try yourself email jody clients you only have few megabytes ram then you should think carefully about the number programs you are running think also about the _kind_ programs you are running for example there smaller clock program than xclock unfortunately haven really noticed that programs advertise how large they are the onus the research and spread the word suggestions better alternatives the some the standard clients xclock xterm xbiff are welcome received some contradictory advice from people the subject client programs some advocate the use programs that are strictly xlib based since xaw and other toolkits are rather large others warn that other applications which you are using may have already loaded one more these shared libraries this case using non for example client program may actually _increase_ the amount ram consumed the upshot all this seems don mix toolkits that try and use just athena clients just xview clients just motif clients etc you use more than one then you dragging more than one toolkit library know your environment and think carefully about which client programs would work best together that environment thanks rob sartin 88opensi sartin uunet net duncan sinclair sinclair dcs gla sinclair gla dcs better clock for

the ultimate clock one that consumes resources and takes screen real estate the one that hangs your wall better terminal emulator for from the readme file distributed with xterm abandon all hope who enter here this undoubtedly the most ugly program the distribution ugly maybe but site still the most used suspect that xterm one the most used clients many not most sites laziness isn there better

this was written partial clone xterm you don have rename your resources xvt pretends xterm current version you cannot bind keys you can xterm heard that there are versions xvt with this feature but not found any yet update march 1993 recently had few email conversations with brian warkentin brian warkentine eng sun com regarding xvt questions whether xvt really all faster than xterm for instance xvt may initialize slightly faster but compare scrolling speed try this quickie benchmark bin time etc termcap and see which program can scroll faster also while xterm may slightly larger ram requirements don have any hard numbers here does anyone else shared libraries and shared text segments mean that xterm paging requirements are not that major experiment ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm but made little difference since you never use never gets brought into memory here stand with some conflicting reports the validity xvt over xterm summary caveat emptor your mileage may

client programs work faster from scott barman scott asd com comes suggestion regarding motif text field widgets noticed that during data entry into motif text field widgets was getting slight lag response some keystrokes particularly the initial one the field examining the what was going with xscope found seems that when the resource xmnblinkrate non zero and the focus text field widget even just text widget the beam cursor will blink every time the cursor appears disappears those widgets the widget code making request the server copyarea the user can stop this setting the resource xmnblinkrate not noticeable 40mhz sparc but does make little difference slower system this specific suggestion can probably applied general lots areas consider your heavily used clients are there any minor embellishments that can turned off and thereby save server requests miscellaneous suggestions pretty pictures don use large bitmaps gif etc root window backgrounds the more complicated your root window bitmap the slower the server redrawing your screen when you reposition windows redraw etc these take ram and cpu power work sun sparc and conscious performance issues can comprehend when see people with 4mb sun running xphoon their root window let someone else figure out how much ram would occupied having full screen root image colour workstation you anything like you need all the screen real estate that you can get for clients and rarely see the root window anyway thanks qiang alex zhao azhao arizona edu for reminding this one quicker mouse using xset you can adjust how fast your pointer moves the screen when you move your mouse use xset xinitrc file which lets send pointer across the screen with just flick the wrist see the xset man page for further ideas and information hint

title very fast xset normal fast xset system default accelerated xset default glacial xset programming thoughts joe english joe trystero art com speed applications that you developing there are tons things you can some that stick out for motif programs don set xmfontlist resources for individual buttons labels lists use the defaultfontlist labelfontlist whatever resource the highest level manager widget again stick few fonts possible better yet don use motif all absolute pig don create and destroy widgets the fly try reuse them this will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits too use line width gcs some servers this makes huge difference compress and collapse multiple expose events this can make the difference between fast application and completely unusable one francois staes frans kiwi uia just small remark once heard that using better malloc function would greatly increase performance based applications since they use malloc heavily they suggested trying out the gnuy malloc but didn find the time yet did some tests small programs just doing malloc and free and the differences were indeed very noticeable somewhat times faster any confirmation this from anyone andre beck andre_beck irs inf dresden unnecessary noexpose events most people use xcopyarea xcopyplane fastest blit routines but they forget reset graphics_exposures the used for the blits this will cause noexpose event every blit that most cases only puts load onto the connection and forces the client run through event loop again and again thousands xchangegc requests this gfx context switching also seen most handcoded apps where only one few gcs are created and then heavily changed again and again uses definitely better mechanism caching and sharing lot gcs with all needed parameters this will remove the load subsequent xchangegc requests from the connection moving toward the client startup phase say what some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall first david lewis day dbl osf org night david craft uunet net how about this swap displays with someone else run all your programs the other machine and display locally the other user runs off your machine onto the other display goal reduce context switches the same operation between client and server not situation where can easily try this but have received the following confirmation michael salmon michael salmon eos ericsson regularly run programs other machines and notice big difference try run machine where will reduce net usage and usually with nice reduce the impact intrusion this helps lot poor little ss1 with only was essential when only had casey leedom casey gauss llnl gov the x11 server and the client are competing for the same cpu your server when you run the same machine not really major problem except that the x11 client and the server are absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing timothy panton thp westhawk uucp firstly relies the fact that most cpu are mostly idle cpu usage bursty the chances you and your teammate doing something cpu intensive the same time small they are not then you get twice the cpu memory available for your action the second factor that context switches are expensive using cpu halves them you pay price due the overhead going over the network but this offset most cases the improved buffering network typically 20k for pipe allowing even fewer context

unconventional peace proposal unconventional proposal for peace the middle east elias davidsson the following proposal based the following assumptions fundamental human rights such the right life education establish family and have children human dignity the right free movement free expression etc are more important human existence that the rights states the event conflict between basic human rights and rights collectivities basic human rights should prevail between the collectivities defining themselves jewish israeli and palestinian arab however labelled unresolved conflict exists this conflict has caused great sufferings for millions people moreover poisons relations between communities peoples and nations each year the united states expends billions dollars economic and military aid the conflicting parties attempts solve the israeli arab conflict traditional political means have failed long the conflict perceived that between two distinct ethnical religious communities peoples which claim the land there just nor peaceful solution possible love between human beings can capitalized for the sake peace and justice when people love they share having stated assumptions will now state proposal fund should established which would disburse grants for each child born couple where one partner israeli jew and the other palestinian arab entitled for grant couple will have prove that one the partners possesses entitled israeli citizenship under the law return and the other partner although born areas under current isreali control not entitled such citizenship under the law return for the first child the grant will amount 000 for the second the third child 000 for each child for each subsequent child the grant will amount 000 for each child the fund would financed variety sources which have shown interest promoting peaceful solution the israeli arab conflict including the government jewish and christian organizations the and great number governments and international organizations the emergence considerable number mixed marriages israel palestine all whom would have relatives both sides the divide would make the conflict lose its ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence truly civil society the existence strong mixed stock people would also help the integration israeli society into the middle east graceful manner objections this proposal will certainly voiced will attempt identify some these the idea providing financial incentives selected forms partnership and marriage not conventional however based the concept affirmative action which recognized legitimate form public policy reverse the perverse effects segregation and discrimination international law clearly permits affirmative action when aimed reducing racial discrimination and segregation may objected that the israeli palestinian conflict not primarily religious ethnical conflict but that conflict between colonialist settler society and indigenous colonized society that can only regain its freedom armed struggle this objection based the assumption that the enemy not zionism ideology and practice but israeli jewish society and its members which will have defeated this objection has merit because does not fulfill the first two assumptions concerning the primacy fundamental human rights over collective rights see above fundamentalist jews would certainly object the use financial incentives encourage mixed marriages from their point view the continued existence specific jewish people overrides any other consideration human love peace human rights the president the world jewish congress edgar bronfman reflected this view few years ago interview gave der spiegel german magazine called the increasing assimilation jews the world calamity comparable its effects only with the holocaust this objection has merit either because does not fulfill the first two assumptions see above may objected that only few people israel palestine would request such grants and that would thus not serve its purpose this objection one might respond that although not possible determine with certainty the effect such proposal the existence such fund would help mixed couples resist the pressure their respective societies and encourage young couples reject fundamentalist and racist attitudes may objected that such fund would need great sums bring about substantial demographic changes this objection has merits however must remembered that huge sums more than billion are expended each year the united states government and organizations maintain elusive peace the middle east through armaments mere fraction these sums would suffice launch the above proposal and create more favorable climate towards the existence mixed marriages israel

used gcc compile the whole distribution but get several segmentation faults when running note first that gcc risc machines does not necessarily result any performance increase certainly not noticeable the 680x0 vax platforms here the problem gcc and use incompatible methods passing structures arguments and returning them function values when gcc compiled parts are linked with sun supplied functions that pass return structs run time errors occur affected programs include rgb and the server this from the gcc manual the sparc gnu uses incompatible calling convention for structures passes them including their contents the argument list whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively reference this really ought fixed but such calling conventions are not yet supported gnu isn straightforward fix the convention for structure returning also incompatible and fpcc struct return does not help you can duck the problem either using throughout using for just the routines which cause incompatibilities the problem cannot solved with compilation flags files which need compiled using include server 2bsd oscolor rgb rgb addition several the inet_ functions use structs args return values clients xhost xhost clients xauth gethost calls inet_addr lib clx socket and lib xconndis are possibly harmless they don involve structs collected bashford scripps edu don bashford

running the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn work you can this simple test include sys ioctl siocgifconf run that through and gcc the last line output the piece interest should identical modulo irrelevant differences like whitespace the gcc version has where the version has your fixincludes run didn work for some reason other back your gcc sources and run fixincludes then rebuild the

cg3ac_monolen define cg3bc_enblen cg3ac_monolen however the sun3 should not actually ever have the cg3 device and references can removed from mit server ddx sun suninit and the imakefile subject 100

cg6_vaddr_color 0x70016000 the file has changed from earlier versions sunos and should not copied from another distribution subject 101 what are these problems using shared libraries sunos all the executables that try run have the following results libxmu not found even call undefined procedure __gethostname from 0xf776a96c you are building with shared libraries sun remember that you need run ldconfig root after installing the shared libraries you installed file server run the server clients too while building and installing the distribution you need careful avoid linking against any existing shared libraries you might have those distributed with openwindows you should make sure you not have ld_library_path set your environment during the build the installation you are going keep xterm and xload setuid programs please note that the shared libraries must installed usr lib usr local lib usr 5lib for these programs work else those programs must linked statically courtesy mit consortium note also that the program mkfontdir run part the build attempts however use the shared libraries before they have been installed you can avoid the errors building mkfontdir statically pass bstatic most compilers subject 102 can olit programs run with _xtqstring undefined this bug the olit _xtqstring was external symbol that existed x11r4 upon which libxt based wasn documented and was removed x11r5 mit guarantee upward compatibility between the and libraries only applied the documented interface workaround temporarily set your ld_library_path point the x11r4 openwindows library that you linked the program against from barry margolin barmar think com from jeff francis jpf heliocentric com subject 103 how get around the sunos security hole there security problem with certain clients xterm and xload running under sunos that have been installed setuid root and are using shared libraries avoid the problem one these make the program non setuid you should consult your system administrator concerning protection resources ptys and dev kmem used these programs make sure that you not create additional security problems your site relink the programs statically using bstatic install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths the libraries from rws expo lcs mit edu bob scheifler the version xterm does this automatically rebuilding xterm against the newly installed libraries when xterm being installed this prevents suid program from being built with libraries specified relatively note that this may cause inconvenience when doing the installation from nfs mounted disks xload has been rewritten avoid the problem subject 104 how get around the frame buffer security hole many systems the frame buffer unsecured default this permits anyone who can log

routines when try compile certain programs get the following link error undefined _xshapequeryextension _xshapecombinemask these routines are actually part the shape extension shape which was introduced the mit x11r4 distribution and allows non rectangular windows like the other sample server extensions the shape extension will only run server which supports pre x11r4 servers well many vendor supplied servers not support the shape extension which case they will display rectangular windows anyway order use the shape extension you must link the library libxext the x11r4 distribution this library and the associated includes will the mit extensions directory you not have these files not despair many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also compiled without removing the dshape define from the makefile you can probably this and compile successfully against your older vendor supplied libraries from john melby melby fujitsu uunet net subject 110 what are these problems with _xtinherit not found the sun when run program that wrote sunos machine get the error symbol not found _xtinherit what you are seeing side effect kludge the libxt get sun shared libraries working apparently you can share function that both called and compared _xtinherit this was handled putting _xtinherit the same file function that always used thereby guaranteeing that would loaded that initialize where xttoolkitinitialize and xtinitialize reside these routines would normally called you are probably seeing this error because your program not normal based program and does not call xttoolkitinitialize anywhere may program that uses functions but never opens connection the server osf motif uil had this problem called xtmalloc and other functions the solution add the call your program the function does not have executed just linked alternatively your program doesn need any functions and correct not calling xttoolkitinitialize may xlib xview program this case you can remove lxt from your link command should not necessary link the shared libraries statically although this will certainly solve the problem from jordan hayes now jordan moorenet com and danny backx

select for sic the window manager controls how the input focus transferred from one window another order get keystrokes your program must ask the window manager for the input focus this you must set what are called hints for the window manager your applications xlib based you can use something like the following xwmhints wmhints wmhints flags inputhint wmhints input true xsetwmhints dpy window wmhints your application based the intrinsics you can set the xtninput resource true you probably want any case you don have source you can start the application with the resource input true certain window managers notably dxwm and olwm are very picky about having this done you are using sun openwindows olwm you can also add this resource your defaults file use clients that aren icccm compliant openwindows focuslenience true mostly courtesy dave lemke ncd and stuart marks sun subject 114 how figure out what window manager running you can reliably tell whatever mechanism you could use could spoofed any case for most cases you shouldn care which window manager running long you things icccm conformant manner there are some cases which particular window managers are known things wrong checking for particular hints placed the window the window manager that you can sidestep the problem may appropriate these cases alternatively may appropriate determine which window manager running order take advantage specific added features such olwm push pin menus order give your program added functionality beware usurping the window manager functions providing that functionality even when missing this surely leads future compatibility problems subject 115 there skeleton program available there general framework such the transskel program for the macintosh which handles lots the odds

sensitive the type variable your code may doing something like this arg args int int sensitive oops wrong data type xtsetarg args xtnsensitive sensitive xtgetvalues widget args but xtnsensitive boolean which most machines single byte declaring the variable sensitive boolean works properly this problem comes often when using particular toolkits that redefine the types dimension and position code that assumes they are int will have similar problems those types are actually short general you are safe you use the actual type the resource appears the widget man page subject 117 why don xtconfigurewidget xtresizewidget xtmovewidget work you probably trying use these functions from application code they should used only internally widgets these functions are for parent widget change the geometry its children other promising functions xtmakegeometryrequest and xtmakeresizerequest are also for use only widgets this case child request change from its parent the only way for your application request geometry change for widget issue xtsetvalues call setting some the geometry resources although this will result the widget internal functions being called your application code must use the standard xtsetvalues interface risk the widgets data becoming corrupted the xlib calls xmovewindow and xresizewindow should similarly avoided they shouldn used change xtnx xtny xtnwidth xtnheight subject 118 why isn there xtreparentwidget call like xreparentwindow although there are various details the current implementation the internals which make reparenting difficult the major reason that such call exists that remains undefined what the set resources for the new widget should resources are typically set based the location the instance hierarchy what resources should change the instance moves what should happen the widget children and the time such semantics are defined there would probably little advantage over destroying the old widget and creating new widget the

house office the press secretary _________________________________________________________________ for immediate release april 1993 remarks the president summer jobs conference hyatt regency crystal city virginia edt the president thank you very much the speech that octavius gave says more than anything will able say today about why important give all our young people chance get work experience and continue learn merge the nature learning and work why important honor the efforts people like jerry levin and nancye combs and pat irving and all those who are here want thank the secretaries labor and education and all the people who work with them for sponsoring this and good friend governor wilder for being here and for speaking and all the business and local community leaders from the city and county and state level from around america who are here this has been pretty fun day laughter loved hearing the young people sing was music ears because their future that are really struggling about applause year and half ago began the quest seek the presidency because was concerned about their future because believe that our country which had always been beacon hope for the young had too little opportunity was too divided among ourselves across lines income and race and region and other ways without vision take into the future entered with the hope that together could create more opportunity and insist much more responsibility from all our people but the process might recreate the best america community knowing that together could always more than could individually and that might secure our future all you here today are committed that the 000 jobs that jerry levin has committed time warner symbolic the commitments made many the private sector people who are here and those who are around the country the work that nancye combs does and the successes all the young people like those this stage and especially the eloquent statement octavius jeffers all those things show that together know what need and the right track last july when was traveling across america heartland luxurious bus visited seneca high school louisville kentucky and there met young people and business people who were participating the louisville education and employment partnership saw what nancye combs talked about today saw how the young people were making extra effort succeed both school and work saw have seen many times own state the principle illustrated that octavius has talked about that for millions american young people really impediment both their learning and their ability good workers draw sharp dividing line between what work and what learning the world which are living the average young person will change the nature work seven eight times lifetime must learn merge the work world and the learning world much better and must determine that all our young people see the opportunities that some them have had showcased here today whether you business government education you know that have big job when comes building future that really honestly includes opportunity for all our people there are still lot people who say well things are pretty good here washington and everything fine the best thing can about this whole thing nothing they all have jobs laughter all the people who say that applause they all have health insurance they all have pretty good education and they all have pretty secure knowledge that they okay matter what happens say that not either political unduly critical but point out that one the great challenges this age for every advanced nation everyone fully develop the capacities all its people and then find work for them all the european countries have higher unemployment rates than but also stronger support systems for the unemployed the japanese unemployment rate has been going they going adopt stimulus that even you count its most rigorous terms three four times bigger than the one that have proposed create jobs west germany alone the unemployment rate now about high ours this big problem for advanced nations costs lot money add extra employee with lot pressure from low wage producers other countries that are growing their own economies and trying provide new opportunity for their people but especially important for america for two reasons one have whole lot folks who unless move aggressively will not have the education and skills need competitive and productive nation like this the second even educate them all there aren jobs they will robbed the fruits their educational labors people need able work this country applause have always had some unemployment and indeed some normal you always got some people leaving jobs and moving around the country and doing first one thing and another have now this moment our history the necessity for all big organizations including the government reexamine the way they are organized and who ask whether there are too many people working some kinds jobs but the whole must still able create jobs country like america provide people with the chance work going difficult for make the welfare reform proposals that will make congress the next couple months going hard for make those work the end all this work get off welfare there isn job applause have two tasks one develop the capacity the american people perform without regard race income the circumstances their birth the other make sure that there are some opportunities for them bring bear for their talent and rewarded with paycheck great challenge not pretend that all the answers are simple but know you want ask the american people all them more responsible you want recreate sense community this country that bridges the lines race and income and region you have got have opportunity that mix part our vision for america has future for every young person this country who willing play the rules and work hard and strive for the end the rainbow there has something the end that rainbow and that what are basically here talk about today what can all partners recognizing none can alone develop the capacities our people succeed wherever they live and whatever their background and then what can make sure that there something there for them the summer jobs program discussing today integral part that plan because will promote the values work and opportunity and fairness community will put the people first and does have partnership between the public and private sector said when addressed the united states congress february this program that would seek create about 700 000 extra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the american business community meet that target that can create more than million new summer jobs over and above what had been created before many many people have responded that challenge and jerry just shining example that which has been replicated this room and around the country people who are going more than they otherwise would the private sector give young people work experience and terribly important want emphasize that this summer jobs program part overall commitment increase the capacity the american people from retraining defense workers who lose their jobs and other adults who need acquire new skills improving the transition from school work for young people who don college but need least two years post high school training either the job community college vocational setting that they can competitive workers making possible for more people college who want all these things are part and parcel comprehensive plan also important said that create more jobs the emergency jobs program that asked the congress adopt would create half million extra jobs over the next year and half and that would reduce the unemployment rate half percent would also enable absorb more young people coming into the work force jobs that otherwise will not created also will help lot cities and counties invest things that need done the grass roots level projects long delayed water projects sewer projects park projects new industries and particularly small and medium size communities whole range things that will improve the economy and improve the environment the summer jobs program important part that because have tried for the first time through the work the labor department and the education department and through reaching out people like you make this more than just one shot summer jobs program integrate with private sector efforts hopefully replicate each coming summer move these young people into further educational opportunities and further job opportunities and have strong meaningful education component these summer jobs something that the united states government has never fully emphasized before lot these young people you well know because they come from difficult backgrounds because they school difficult and challenging circumstances need extra help building their basic skills math and language reasoning and other areas and lot educational studies show that young people who have difficulty school often forget much percent what they learn over the summer and then that has repeated the next year what are trying here give people the opportunity learn good work habits and reinforce their learning skills and put them together and then hopefully over the next couple years our entire program passes give every school this country the opportunity have good work and learning environment there will more applied academics more opportunities for people learn and work during the school year that this will not simply isolated moment for these young folks but will part building whole new educational experience whole new work experience and moving pathway better future the summer jobs programs are not designed make work jobs they designed make future for the people holding the job and that what they will the process they help build local communities strengthen local economies solve local problems real jobs renovating housing repairing public buildings doing clerical work providing nursing assistance hospitals supervising and training children child care centers and learning all the way challenging young people learn while they earn but letting them earn you know very difficult make case people who have never seen opportunity their own street that they should this that the other thing there evidence the opportunity that the end the effort have not been sparing going for the last year and half into places where isn exactly popular say and say wanted reform the welfare system wanted toughen child support wanted require people work was sick and tired people being irresponsible the use guns the streets and wanted change all that but you going summon people greater responsibility you have reward them when they the right thing with opportunity applause the young people propose put work under our program will spend hours learning basic skills such math reading writing either the job the classroom they will stretch their minds well work sweat they will have sense accomplishment will literally summer challenge but challenge that will take them into different life want ask all you support this effort even your president support your effort the end the summer will evaluate all the young people who participate see whether they instead falling behind over the summer academically too many young people they stayed even moved ahead suspect that they will this summer secretary reich and secretary riley and will visiting many your communities really try learn from you which these efforts are working what should next summer how can build what goes during the school year how can build our job training efforts and the works that with your companies make sense this whole thing that maximize the impact the taxpayer dollar and your private investments well want honor the companies and the communities the business leaders and the young people who the very best jobs this summer and again want say all you private business who have matched our effort thank you and all you who haven and those across the country who may listen learn about this event today want implore other private employers stretch little bit give other young people chance work this summer telling you cannot through another years when don give these children anything say yes exhort them right got able reward them applause when the other speakers were talking was sitting here the platform listening and reveling and they got talking about work and got thinking about all the different things done make living life when was made very foolish short term business investment set comic book stand and sold two trunks full comic books made more money than had ever had life but had saved those trunks they worth 100 000 today laughter that does not mean young people should not entrepreneurial just means that you can foresee generation ahead have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and worked body shops and the parts departments car dealership and done lot different things for living some people say got into politics escape work laughter learned something from every job ever had but grew generation where literally did not know living soul without regard race income who wanted work who didn have job grew generation when all you had really say people get education and you all right you get job and you make more money next year than you did this year now live generation full people most whom don make any more money real dollars than they did years ago and they working longer hours and they paying more for the basics life and are now wondering whether can create the jobs that these young people want now want close reemphasizing these two things doesn matter what kind economic policies this administration pursues how much productivity increases there are the private sector young americans don get good education don learn how work and can productive those jobs will not created this country machines will the work the work will done off shore people who have the same skill levels and can work for third fourth fifth the wages nothing can economically will matter unless build the skills and capacities america work force and anybody that pretends otherwise just kidding the other hand need honest every wealthy country the world including the united states having difficulty creating jobs knew everything that needs done glad tell you and could just call off the whole deliberations congress and everything else don have all the answers but know this doing nothing not the answer applause and the jobs program that have presented congress with the summer jobs with the money for the cities and the counties through the community development program with the infrastructure money small part big budget attempt engage experiment see whether not with the economy recovering terms corporate profit can give little boost give opportunities young people create half million jobs and maybe get the engine going again most the jobs this program are going jobs the private sector not government jobs even though government money and the lion share the work rebuilding the american economy obviously will come from the private sector that the kind system have and works pretty well but this the challenge have ask all you here today support the summer jobs program ask your friends and neighbors support back home and ask your employers make little extra effort what you can help pass the funds create the 700 000 jobs that the united states government should create this summer that together can have this partnership because more than anything else have give future future that our young people can believe need send them message that here america you study hard and work hard you obey the law and contribute something your community you will rewarded your country you can build future from you own dreams that has always been the promise america together that what this summer challenge needs reaffirmation the promise america for many young people whom that promise has been illusion can make reality thank you very much applause end11 edt

with these guidelines changes from the 1993 draft are noted change bars xwhat new 1993 the entry format better for anyway the program mkentry has been updated see entry format will reject entries that cannot compiled using ansi compiler certain old obfuscation hacks that cause ansi compilers fits are longer permitted some the new issues deal with non integral array types variable number arguments preprocessor directives and the exit function see our likes and dislikes xhints and suggestions you are encouraged examine the winners previous contests see for more information for details how get previous winners keep mind that rules change from year year some winning entries may not valid entries this year what was unique and novel one year might old the next year entry usually examined number ways typically apply number tests entry look the original source convert ansi tri graphs ascii pre process the source ignoring include lines pre process the source ignoring define and include lines run through beautifier examine the algorithm lint compile execute you should consider how your entry looks each the above tests you should ask yourself your entry remains obscure after has been cleaned the pre processor and beautifier your entry need not well under all most tests certain cases test not important entries that compete for the strangest most creative source layout need not well others terms their algorithm the other hand given two such entries are more inclined pick the entry that does something interesting when you run try avoid limiting creativity our rules such leave the contest open for creative rule interpretation real life programming interpreting requirements document customer request important for this reason often award worst abuse the rules entry that illustrates this point ironic way you plan abuse the rules suggest that you let know the remarks section please note that invitation abuse not invitation break are strict when comes the 3217 byte size limit also abusing the entry format tends annoy more than amuse realize that there are holes the rules and invite entries attempt exploit them will award worst abuse the rules and then plug the hole next year even will attempt use the smallest plug needed not smaller check out your program and sure that works sometimes make the effort debug entry that has slight problem particularly near the final round the other hand have seen some the best entries fall down because they didn work tend look down prime number printer that claims that prime number you have bug you are better off documenting noting this entry sometimes prints the 4th power prime mistake would save the above entry and sometimes strange bug feature can even help the entry course correctly working entry best xour likes and dislikes doing masses defines obscure the source has become old tend see thru masses defines due our pre processor tests that apply simply abusing defines dfoo bar won far program that more well rounded confusion many ansi compilers dislike the following code and define define foo don expect this turn into define foo int don use such implicit type declaration int suggest that you compile your entry with ansi compiler you must use non ansi such you must avoid areas that result compile link errors for ansi compilers unfortunately some ansi compilers require array indexes integral type thus the following classical obfuscation hacks should not used 1993 this rule may relaxed future contests int char use instead string use string instead your entry uses functions that have variable number arguments careful systems implement va_list wide variety ways because this number operations using va_list are not portable and must not used assigning non va_list variable from va_list variable casting non va_list variable into from va_list variable passing va_list variable function expecting non va_list arg passing non va_list variable function expecting va_list arg performing arithmetic va_list variables using va_list structure union particular not treat va_list variables they were char avoid using varargs use stdarg instead you use preprocessor directives define ifdef the leading must the first character line while some preprocessors allow whitespace the leading many not because the exit function returns void some systems entries must not assume that returns int small programs are best when they are short obscure and concise while such programs are not complex other winners they serve useful purpose they are often the only program that people attempt completely understand for this reason look for programs that are compact and are instructional one line programs should short one line programs say around bytes long getting close 160 bytes bit too long our opinion tend dislike programs that are very hardware specific are very version specific index strchr differences are but socket streams specific code likely not dump core have compiler warnings only you warn the remark header item won compile under both bsd sys abusing the build file get around the size limit obfuscate excessive use ansi tri graphs are longer than they need are similar previous winners are identical previous losers unless you are cramped for space unless you are entering the best one liner category suggest that you format your program more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines the build file should not used try and get around the size limit one thing make use several help out but quite another use 200 bytes order try and squeeze the source under the size limit you should feel free make use the build file space but you are better off you show some amount restraint allowed whitespace and certain cases not impact your program size certain point because want get away from source that simply compact blob characters given two versions the same program one that compact blob code and the other that formatted more like typical program tend favor the second version course third version the same program that formatted interesting and obfuscated way would definitely win over the first two suggest that you avoid trying for the smallest self replicating program are amazed the many different sizes that claim the smallest there nothing wrong with self replicating programs fact number winners have been self replicating you might want avoid the claim smallest lest others know smaller one client entries should portable possible entries that adapt wide collection environments will favored don depend particular type display for example don depend color given size don require backing store client entries should avoid using related libraries and software that not wide spread use ask that such client entries restrict themselves only the low level xlib and the athena widget set libx11 libxaw libxmu and libxt don use tif openl toolkits since not everyone has them avoid depending particular window manager not everyone has x11r5 and some people are stuck back x11r4 earlier try target x11r5 without requiring x11r5 better yet try make your entry run all version window systems client entries should not depend particular items xdefaults you must sure note the required lines the remark section like programs that are concise and small they need something least quasi interesting pass lint without complaint not requirement but nice are portable are unique novel their obfuscation style make use number different types obfuscation make laugh and throw some types programs can excel some areas course your program doesn have excel all areas but doing well several areas really does help freely admit that interesting creative humorous comments the remark section helps your chance winning you had read many twisted entries you too would enjoy good laugh two think the readers the contest winners well creative xentry format order help process the many entries must request your assistance formatting your entries certain way this format addition allows quickly separate information about the author from the program itself see judging process have provided the program mkentry example how format entries you should aware the following warning that found mkentry this program attempts implement the ioccc rules every attempt has been made make sure that this program produces entry that conforms the contest rules all cases where this program differs from the contest rules the contest rules will used sure check with the contest rules before submitting entry you are not required use mkentry convenient however attempts uuencode the needed files and attempt check the entry against the size rules you have any suggestions comments fixes complaints about the mkentry program please send email the judges see below the following sample entry entry xrule 1993 xfix xtitle chonglab xentry xdate mon mar 1993 xhost pdp11 9bsd pdp11 remark this non obfuscated obfuscated program likely not win prize but what you expect

typically the build file should assume that the source prog and will compile into prog entry wins will rename its source and binary avoid filename collision tradition use the name the entry title followed optional digit case name conflicts the above entry somehow won the least likely win award would use chonglab and chonglab your entry depends requires that your build source and binary files particular name please say the remark section this case applies would helpful you did one the following tell how change the filename your entry have the build file make copies the files for example prog special_name need special binary special_src need special source prog special_src special_src special_name special_build need special build tail build special_build special_build assume that will use the entry title send version your build program files that uses the name convention you should uuencode these files data sections your entry needs modify its source info binary files please say the remark section you should try avoid touching your original build source and binary files you should arrange make copies the files you intend modify this will allow people generate your entry from scratch remember that your entry may built without build file typically incorporate the build lines into makefile the build file must exist say the remark section your entry needs special info files you should uuencode them into info sections the case multiple info files use multiple info sections info files are needed then skip the info section info files are intended input detailed information that does not fit well into the remark section for example entry that implements compiler might want provide some sample programs for the user compile entry might want include lengthy design document that might not appropriate for hints file info files should used only supplement your entry for example info files may provide sample input detailed information about your entry because they are supplemental the entry should not require them exist some cases your info files might renamed avoid name conflicts info files should not renamed for some reason say the remark section info files must uudecode into the current directory they absolutely must renamed moved into sub directory say the remark section when submitting multiple entries sure that each entry has unique entry number from your first entry should have entry number with the exception the header all text outside the entry format may ignored that don place text outside the entry and expect the judges see our decoding tools aren progs you need tell the the something put the remark section send email the judges apple pyramid sun uunet hoptoad judges not the address for judges toad com submitting entries the date should given with respect utc some systems refer this gmt gmt0 the format the date should that returned asctime the locale example such string thr apr 1993 this format similar the output the date command the string does not include the timezone name before the year many systems one the following command will produce similar string date date sed utc date sed gmt date sed gmt0 date sed you are allowed update fix revise your entry set the fix line the entry section instead sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number well these are used determine which entry replaced xjudging process entries are judged larry bassel and landon curt noll entries are unpacked into individual directories the email message unpacked into individual files each containing entry section all author sections all info sections build section program section any other text including the email message headers prior judging the any other text file scanned sure does not contain useful information case the entry was malformed and did not unpack correctly information from the author sections are not read until the judging process complete and then only from entries that have won award the above process helps keep biased for against any one particular individual are usually kept the dark much you are until the final awards are given like the surprise finding out the end who won and where they were from attempt keep all entries anonymous unless they win award because the main prize winning being announced make all attempts send non winners into oblivion remove all non winning files and shred all related paper tradition not even reveal the number entries that received for the curious indicate the volume paper consumed when presenting the ioccc winners talks after the usenix announcement attempt send email the authors the winning entries one reason this give the authors chance comment the way have presented their entry they are given the chance correct mistakes typos often accept their suggestions comments about our remarks well this done prior posting the winners the wide world judging consists number elimination rounds during round the collection entries are divided into two roughly equal piles the pile that advances the next round and the pile that does not also examine the entries that were eliminated the previous round thus entry gets least two readings reading consists number actions reading the entry section reading the uudecoded build section reading the uudecoded program section reading the uudecoded info section any passing the source thru the pre processor shipping over any include files performing number beautify cleanup edits the source passing the beautified source thru the pre processor shipping over any include files later rounds other actions are performed linting the source compiling building the source running the program performing misc tests the source and binary until reduce the stack entries down about entries entries are judged individual basis entry set aside because does not our opinion meet the standard established the round when the number entries thins about entries begin form award categories entries begin compete with each other for awards entry often will compete several categories the actual award category list will vary depending the types entries receive typical category list might best small one line program best small program strangest most creative source layout most useful obfuscated program best game that obfuscated most creatively obfuscated program most deceptive code best client see our likes and dislikes best abuse ansi worst abuse the rules anything else strange that deserves award not limit ourselves this list for example few entries are good bad that they are declared winners the start the final round will invent awards categories for them necessary the final round process perform the difficult tasks reducing the remaining entries typically about down winners often are confident that the entries that make into the final round are definitely better than the ones that not make the selection the winners out the final round less clear cut sometimes final round entry good enough win but beat out similar but slightly better entry for this reason sometimes worthwhile enter improved version entry that failed win previous year this assumes course that the entry worth improving the first place more often that not select small entry usually one line strange creative layout entry and entry that abuses the contest rules some way the end traditionally pick one entry best sometimes such entry simply far exceeds any the other entry more often the best picked because does well number categories xannouncement winners the first announcement occurs summer usenix

 |text from jhpb sarto budd lake joseph buehler subject sspx schism organization none lines 240 larry overacker writes responding simon may interesting see some brief selections posted the net understanding that sspx does not consider itself schism legitimately excommunicated but that really beside the point what does the roman catholic church say excommunication can real apart from formal excommunication provided for canon law here some the theology involved for the interested there confusion over this issue the sspx schism often the basic problem lack ability distinguish between true obedience false obedience disobedience schism take the various classifications obedience first there are important elements involved here for purposes command the response made the command far the command goes commands can legitimate such the pope ordering catholics not eat meat fridays they can illegitimate such the pope ordering catholics worship the god dagon when every other full moon comes around far the response command goes can refuse what commanded comply making table there are thus possibilites command response name legitimate comply true obedience illegitimate refuse true obedience legitimate refuse disobedience illegitimate comply false obedience now you see where classifications obedience come from obedience not solely matter compliance refusal the nature the commands must also taken into account not enough consider someone compliance refusal and then say whether they are obedient disobedient you also have take into consideration whether the commands are good bad example the pope commands all catholics worship the god dagon and they all refuse they aren being disobedient all far the society saint pius goes they are certainly refusing comply with certain things the pope desires but that alone insufficient allow one label them disobedient you also have consider the nature the papal desires and there the rub sspx says the popes since vatican have been commanding certain very bad things for the church the popes have course disagreed where are are another arian heresy complete with weak popes are the sspx priests modern martin luthers well the only way answer that examine who saying what and what the traditional teaching the church the problem here that very few catholics have much idea what really going and what the issues are the religion american catholics especially defective intellectual depth you will never read about the issues being discussed the catholic press this country the other hand one italian catholic magazine get days has had interviews with the superior general the society saint pius many catholics will decide side with the pope there some soundness this because the papacy infallible eventually some pope will straighten all this out but the other hand there also unsoundness this that the short term the popes may indeed wrong and such catholics are doing nothing help the situation obeying them where they wrong fact the situation grave enough they sin obeying him the very least they wasting great opportunity because they are failing love christ heroic way the very time that needs this badly schism let move schism what schism superset disobedience refusal obey legitimate command all schismatics are disobedient but superset doesn work the other way around not all disobeyers are schismatics the mere fact that the sspx priests don comply with the holy father desires doesn make them schismatics what that must added disobedience constitute schism maybe this something else makes the sspx priests schismatics you must add this the rejection the right command look any decent reference catholic theology and that what you find the distinguishing criterion schism rejection the right command here what the catholic encyclopedia says for example not every disobedience schism order possess this character must include besides the trangression the commands superiors denial their divine right command from the article schism the society saint pius then schismatic the answer clear they say that the pope their boss they pray for him every day and that all that matters far schism goes what all this boils down this leave aside the consideration the exact nature their objections their position legitimate one far the catholic theology obedience and schism goes they are resisting certain papal policies because they think that they are clearly contrary the traditional teaching the papacy and the best interests the church fact someone who finds himself this situation has duty resist now what the stance rome all this well you read the holy father motu proprio ecclesia dei you can find out the definitive document the subject motu proprio specifically papal act not the product roman congregation letter that the pope has possibly never even read from the pope himself his boss god there one else complain this document the holy father says among other things the episcopal consecrations performed archbishop lefebvre constituted schismatic act archbishop lefebvre problem was misunderstanding the nature tradtion both are confusing fail see the logic the pope points far the episcopal consecrations read interesting article translation the italian magazine all gets back the question jurisdiction episcopal consecrations imply rejection the pope jurisdiction then they would truly constitute schismatic act justifying excommunication under the current code canon law but problem with this this according the traditional theology holy orders episcopal consecration does not confer jurisdiction only confers the power order the ability confect the sacraments jurisdiction must conferred someone else with the power confer such the pope the society bishops knowing the traditional theology quite well take great pains avoid any pretence jurisdiction over anyone they simply confer those sacraments that require bishop the article was interesting that posited that the reason that the pope said what did that has novel post vatican idea holy orders according this idea episcopal consecration does confer jurisdiction lent the article friend unfortunately can tell you more believe they quoted the new code canon law support this idea the pope thinking this point remains great puzzle there way there schism according traditional catholic theology why does the pope think this far the points regarding the nature tradition goes here the passage question the root this schismatic act can discerned incomplete and contradictory notion tradtion incomplete because does not take sufficiently into the account the living character tradition which the second vatican council clearly taught comes from the apostles and progresses the church with the help the holy spirit there growth insight into the realities and words that are being passed this comes about various ways comes through the contemplation and study believers who ponder these things their hearts comes from the intimate sense spiritual realities which they experience and comes from the preaching those who have received along with their right succession the espiscopate the sure charism truth but especially contradictory notion tradition which opposes the universal magisterium the church possessed the bishop rome and the body bishops impossible remain faithful the tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond with him whom the person the apostle peter christ himself entrusted the ministry unity his church papal motu proprio ecclesia dei july 1988 seems that the holy father making two points here that can simplified the following vatican council has happened the pope the argument being that either case sufficient prove that archbishop lefebvre must wrong because disagrees with them this weak say the least would have helped clarify things more the pope had addressed archbishop lefebvre concerns detail what john paul stand the social kingship christ taught gregory xvi pius leo xiii pius and pius xii for example are supposed ignore what all these popes said the subject don know what the future will hold but the powers that the sspx are still talking with rome and trying straighten things out many people would prefer call justified refusal obey justified disobedience even obeying god rather than man calling refusal obey obedience puts into sort alice wonderland world where words mean whatever want them mean similarly schism indicates formal break the church the pope says that schism exists seems that definition exists may that the pope the wrong side the break that there good reason for the break exist and that will shortly healed but how can one deny that does fact exist seems that you are grave danger destroying the thing you are trying reform the power the papacy what good will you you become reconciled the the pope the future but the process you have destroyed his ability use the tools church discipline one thing hold that the pope has misused his powers and excommunicated someone wrongly something else say that his excommunication did not take effect and the schism all his imagination that means that acts church discipline are not legal tools but acts whose validity open debate generally has been liberal catholics who have had problems with the pope while they have often objected church sanctions generally they have admitted that the sanctions exist you are now opening the door people simply ignoring papal decisions claiming truly obeying disobeying and communion while excommunicated this would seem precisely the denial divine right command that you say defines schism clh

israel should totally back down the easiest way get away with attacking another use innocent shield and hope that the other respects innocent lives tell tim what are these guerillas doing wrong assuming that they are using civilians for cover assuming also come brad are going get anywhere this any discussion doesn help bring elements never addressed nor commented any way made comment who right who wrong only that civilians are being used cover and that having been placed between the israelis and the guerillas they will injured both parties continue their fight the purpose army use military uniforms set its members apart from the civilians that civilians will not thought the other side combatants what you think the meaning behind the intention and the effect when army purposely does not were uniforms but goes out its way look like civilians they are judging that the benefit they will receive from this cover more important that the harm that will come civilians this comment the israeli experience and saying that the guerillas have some responsibility putting civilians the middle this fight putting uniforms and living apart from civilians barracks etc the guerillas would significantly lower the risk civilians but the guerillas this aren they putting themselves greater risk absolutely they ask themselves why set ourselves apart wearing uniforms when there ready made cover for civilians that makes sense from their point view but when this cover used the guerillas should accept some the responsibility for subsequent harm civilians the buffer zone prevent attacks israel not working why further neccessary for israeli guns pound lebanese villages why not just kill those who try infiltrate the buffer zone you see there more the shelling the villages called retaliation getting back getting even doesn make sense shell the villages the least shows reckless disregard the israeli government for the lives civilians agree with you here have always thought that israel bombing sortees and bombing policy stupid thoughtless inhumane and ineffective but there reason that israel should passive wait until attackers chose act there every reason believe that taking the fight the enemy will more stop attacks said previously israel spent several decades sitting passively its side border and only acting stop these attacks after the attackers had entered israeli territory didn work very well the host arab state did little nothing try and stop these attacks from its side the border with israel the number attacks were considerably higher was their physical and psychological impact the civilians caught their path what the whole bit about attacks israel from neighboring arab states can start all over again while also hope for this happen will only occur when arab states show that they are prepared take the responsibility and the duty stop guerilla attacks israel from their soil they have prove provide some guaratees there way israel going accept their word not with their past attitude tolerance towards anti israel guerillas residence israel not willing accept the word others then imho has business wasting others time coming the peace talks this just another selectively applied statement the reason for this drawn out impasse between ababs palestinians and israelis that neither side willing accept the word the other your criteria everyone should stay away from the negotiations that precisely why the palestinians their recent pisga proposal for the interim period after negotiations and leading full autonomy are demanding conditions that essentially define autonomy already they not trust that israel will follow through the entire process and allow palestinians reach full autonomy you understand and accept this viewpoint the palestinians you then why should israel view arabs palestinians any different why should they trust the arab palestinians words since they don they are very reluctant give tangible assets land control areas exchange for words for this reason they are also concerned about the sorts guarantees they will have that the arabs will follow through their part any agreement reached but don you see that the same statement can made both ways lebanon was interested peace then should accept the word israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy absolutely are the arabs palestinians asking first for the israelis word relation any agreement what being demanded first land when the issue land and one party finally gets hold this land what the other party does totally irrelevent now have possession this land your words have absolutely power whether israel chooses keeps its word does not get the land back afterall israel has already staged two parts the withdrawal from areas occupied lebanon during slg tim you are ignoring the fact that the palestinians lebanon have been disarmed hezbollah remains the only independent militia hezbollah does not attack israel except few times such when the idf burned sheikh mosavi his wife and young son while the major armaments those allowing people wage civil wars have been removed the weapons needed cross border attacks still remain some extent rocket attacks still continue and commando raids only require few easily concealed weapons and refined disregard for human life yours that others such attacks also continue course israel would withdraw from lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn make the lebanese mad that bat guano the situation you call for existed the 1970s and attacks were commonplace furthermore with hezbollah subsequently disarmed would not possible there way these groups can effectively disarmed unless the state authoritarian syria the only other way for lebanon take upon itself constantly patrol the entire border with israel essentially mirroring israel border secirity its side has prove isreal that this committed protecting israel from attack from lebanese territory once syria leaves who say that lebanon will able retain control syria stays thay may even more dangerous for israel tim when the last time that you recall any trouble the syrian border not lately that what said but doesn that mean that syria has take over lebanon don think israel lebanon would like that what both sides need receive something tangible the arabs palestinians are looking for land and demanding that they receive prior giving anything israel israel has two problems gives real land exposing itself changed geostrategic situation and that change doesn help israel position and when gives this land needs receive something return compensate for the increased risks tim

only displaying your ignorance course but each his own roger not sure here but think ignorance really function lack knowledge and not formulating opinion but hey you need take cheap shot then all means ahead that makes you feel better knowledgeable observers the game meaning obvious your hockey education not responsibility hockey education what the are you talking about not even going try refute this absolutely insane statement word such vehemence against poor bob gainey why does bother you much was effective player for his style play was just another player laud him anything more find bothersome hated the habs hated lafleur until realized that was likely the most aesthetically pleasing player ever skate lifetime why would anyone talk about gainey hate the habs you sound like year old this statement just further exemplifies your total inability argue objectively about hockey don give this crap about cogent arguments yet read something yours that cogent you consistently argue with emotion huge sweeping statements frankly you have very unconvincing style not defending bob gainey frankly don care for him all that much but your dismissal him something less than effective hockey player tiresome has basis anything how many calders did win think was four ahead and refresh memory what about the conn smythe was that fluke yeah not the makings hockey superstar know but try have reason any reason shoot him down around who would you rather have your checking centre doug gilmour doug jarvis for that matter would take either gretzky mario checking centres you think gretzky could cover bob gainey really sorry roger but you have lost completely here why don you ask would rather have jesus christ himself nets did play hockey high level was any good not why would you bother bring talking about hockey players here you can follow the conversation don follow said previously not responsibility educate you hey cowboy you the expert who introduced the idiotic comparison gainey with gretzky and lemieux you figure out now you were compare say for example bob gainey with guy carbonneau you would have balanced comparison sure two journeymen big deal neither one them worth discussing how many individual awards between them eight don remember once again please feel free refresh memory and try sarcastic possible about hockey education wrong again hmmm let see where was wrong the would take fuhr and sanderson off the latter god did say that roger what your point fuhr goaltender goaltender don plug his prime was one the best sanderson was scrapper you stick him you may well include half the flyers team the same era first place only guessing here rog but have feeling that you setup you wrong again macro key your machine that excellent idea and decide waste any more time responding any your greg postings then will sure implement that very macro roger you shouldn really don deserve this you are far too accomodating already would suggest that your comment and when the press runs out things say about the stars dynasties they start hype the pluggers grant fuhr essa tikkannen butch goring bob nystrom bob gainey doug jarvis derek sanderson wayne cashman bob baun bob pulford ralph backstrom henri richard dick duff and demonstrates blanket disregard for these individuals contributors the game yes settle down nobody has claimed that they are hockey gods tarasov claimed that gainey was hockey god and greg ate and that what this thread all about you didn know that then why are you responding you seem have allowed all these other players fall into your sweeping vacuous statement that why you want debate gainey ahead but why bring everybody else how does support your argument you have argument you just like throw around few names hoping impress and for blanket disregard for these individuals can remember leaf teams purely populated such individuals winning four stanley cups teams one ran around telling that george armstrong was the best hockey player the world great couldn agree more the flyers won two cups for the same reasons deservedly what don get are you angry that the leafs didn get more recognition you seem think these pluggers are hyped don agree plain and simple you last statement some sort compromise fair enough you might consider developing your own style after all imitation the sincerest form flattery and quite sure that flattery not your intention mon has nice ring and admit you had good laugh right had get the end your posting before realized you were complete joke not pleasant bone your body rog why are you unhappy not getting invited enough parties what the future you are going respond postings would appreciate you could present cogent argument supported facts gleaned from version reality that most the rest

compensation mariner became the first successful probe flyby venus december 1962 and returned information which confirmed that venus very hot 800 degrees fahrenheit now revised 900 degrees world with cloud covered atmosphere composed primarily carbon dioxide sulfuric acid was later confirmed 1978 mariner launched november 1964 was lost when its protective shroud failed eject the craft was placed into interplanetary space unable collect the sun energy for power from its solar panels the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and now solar orbit was intended for mars flyby with mariner mariner the sister probe mariner did reach mars 1965 and took the first close images the martian surface all flew the planet the probe found cratered world with atmosphere much thinner than previously thought many scientists concluded from this preliminary scan that mars was dead world both the geological and biological sense mariner was sent venus 1967 reconfirmed the data that planet collected five years earlier mariner plus the information that venus atmospheric pressure its surface least times that earth the equivalent being 300 feet under the surface ocean mariner and were sent mars 1969 and expanded upon the work done mariner four years earlier however they failed take away the concept mars dead planet first made from the basic measurements mariner mariner ended the atlantic ocean 1971 when the rocket launcher autopilot failed mariner the sister probe mariner became the first craft orbit mars 1971 returned information the red planet that other probe had done before revealing huge volcanoes the martian surface well giant canyon systems and evidence that water once flowed across the planet the probe also took the first detailed closeup images mars two small moons phobos and deimos mariner used venus gravity assist mercury 1974 the probe did return the first close images the venusian atmosphere ultraviolet revealing previously unseen details the cloud cover plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet four earth days mariner eventually made three flybys mercury from 1974 1975 before running out attitude control gas the probe revealed mercury heavily cratered world with mass much greater than thought this would seem indicate that mercury has iron core which makes percent the entire planet pioneer moon sun venus jupiter and saturn flybys and orbiters pioneer through failed meet their main objective photograph the moon close but they did reach far enough into space provide new information the area between earth and the moon including new data the van allen radiation belts circling earth all three craft had failures with their rocket launchers pioneer was launched october 1958 pioneer november and pioneer december pioneer was moon probe which missed the moon and became the first spacecraft orbit the sun 1959 pioneer was originally designed flyby venus but the mission was scaled down and instead studied the interplanetary environment between venus and earth out million kilometers 1960 record until mariner pioneer through were placed into solar orbit from 1965 1968 pioneer and are still transmitting information this time pioneer would have been number suffered launch failure 1969 pioneer became the first spacecraft flyby jupiter 1973 pioneer followed 1974 and then went become the first probe study saturn 1979 both vehicles should continue function through 1995 and are heading off into interstellar space the first craft ever pioneer venus 1978 also known pioneer venus orbiter pioneer burned the venusian atmosphere october 1992 pvo made the first radar studies the planet surface via probe pioneer venus also known pioneer sent four small probes into the atmosphere december 1978 the main spacecraft bus burned high the atmosphere while the four probes descended parachute towards the surface though none were expected survive the surface the day probe did make and transmitted for minutes the ground before its batteries failed ranger lunar lander and impact missions ranger and were test probes for the ranger lunar impact series they were meant for high earth orbit testing 1961 but rocket problems left them useless low orbits which quickly decayed ranger launched january 1962 was intended land instrument capsule the surface the moon but problems during the launch caused the probe miss the moon and head into solar orbit ranger did try take some images the moon flew but the camera was unfortunately aimed deep space during the attempt ranger launched april 1962 had the same purpose ranger but suffered technical problems enroute and crashed the lunar farside the first probe reach the moon albeit without returning data ranger launched october 1962 and similar ranger and lost all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the moon and drifted off into solar orbit ranger through had more modified lunar missions they were send back live images the lunar surface they headed towards impact with the moon ranger failed this objective 1964 when its cameras did not operate ranger through performed well becoming the first lunar probes return thousands lunar images through 1965 lunar orbiter lunar surface photography lunar orbiter through were designed orbit the moon and image various sites being studied landing areas for the manned apollo missions 1969 1972 the probes also contributed greatly our understanding lunar surface features particularly the lunar farside all five probes the series launched from 1966 1967 were essentially successful their missions they were the first probes orbit the moon all los were eventually crashed into the lunar surface avoid interference with the manned apollo missions surveyor lunar soft landers the surveyor series were designed primarily see apollo lunar module could land the surface the moon without sinking into the soil before this time was feared some that the moon was covered great layers dust which would not support heavy landing vehicle surveyor was successful proving that the lunar surface was strong enough hold spacecraft from 1966 1968 only surveyor and were unsuccessful missions the rest became the first probes soft land the moon taking thousands images and scooping the soil for analysis apollo landed 600 feet from surveyor 1969 and returned parts the craft earth surveyor the last the series was purely scientific mission which explored the tycho crater region 1968 viking mars orbiters and landers viking was launched from cape canaveral florida august 1975 titan centaur rocket the probe went into martian orbit june 1976 and the lander set down the western slopes chryse planitia july 1976 soon began its programmed search for martian micro organisms there still debate whether the probes found life there not and sent back incredible color panoramas its surroundings one thing scientists learned was that mars sky was pinkish color not dark blue they originally thought the sky pink due sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles the thin atmosphere the lander set down among field red sand and boulders stretching out far its cameras could image the viking orbiter kept functioning until august 1980 when ran out attitude control propellant the lander was switched into weather reporting mode where had been hoped would keep functioning through 1994 but after november 1982 errant command had been sent the lander accidentally telling shut down until further orders communication was never regained again despite the engineers efforts through may 1983 interesting side note viking lander has been designated the thomas mutch memorial station honor the late leader the lander imaging team the national air and space museum washington entrusted with the safekeeping the mutch station plaque until can attached the lander manned expedition viking was launched september 1975 and arrived martian orbit august 1976 the lander touched down september 1976 utopia planitia accomplished essentially the same tasks its sister lander with the exception that its seisometer worked recording one marsquake the orbiter had series attitude control gas leaks 1978 which prompted being shut down that july the lander was shut down april 1980 the orbits both viking orbiters should decay around 2025 voyager outer planet flybys voyager was launched september 1977 and flew past

advantage rare once every 189 years alignment slingshot its way from outer planet outer planet voyager could principle have headed towards pluto but jpl opted for the sure thing titan close between the two probes our knowledge the giant planets their satellites and their rings has become immense voyager discovered that jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics lightning and aurorae three new satellites were discovered two the major surprises were that jupiter has rings and that has active sulfurous volcanoes with major effects the jovian magnetosphere when the two probes reached saturn they discovered over 1000 ringlets and satellites including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep the rings stable the weather was tame compared with jupiter massive jet streams with minimal variance year great white spot band cycle known titan atmosphere was smoggy mimas appearance was startling one massive impact crater gave the death star appearance the big surprise here was the stranger aspects the rings braids kinks and spokes were both unexpected and difficult explain voyager thanks heroic engineering and programming efforts continued the mission uranus and neptune uranus itself was highly monochromatic appearance one oddity was that its magnetic axis was found highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational axis giving uranus peculiar magnetosphere icy channels were found ariel and miranda was bizarre patchwork different terrains satellites and one more ring were discovered contrast uranus neptune was found have rather active weather including numerous cloud features the ring arcs turned out bright patches one ring two other rings and other satellites were discovered neptune magnetic axis was also skewed triton had canteloupe appearance and geysers what liquid 38k the two voyagers are expected last for about two more decades their target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets beyond pluto their next major scientific

duu encore com rcollins encore com roger collins writes julie eddie jpl nasa gov julie kangas writes suggest you listen very carefully the stuff yeltsin and his people are saying and compare that with the very anti west slogans coming from his opponents the russian congress sure know who want back could back him without forcing others back him the point gun had backed him strongly early doubt there would the problem there now many russians became disillusioned with democracy and reforms when they felt rightly imo that the west didn care yeltsin was virtually promised massive aid once bush got over his gorby mania this probably kept him from dismantling the congress and calling for new elections well the aid didn come through and didn make sure went the proper places and now the anti reformers are gaining strength where before they were hiding have you considered non interventionist policy market reform does happen russia will certainly get private capital private risk help their economy they will even have incentive for the same reason they don reform then our government will probably consider them enemies anyway and rather spend money hurt rather than help them they don reform don believe giving them money however think this too important take non interventionist approach this what really bugs about libertarianism sounds like all the same hundred years time need anything how does this affect well are the same planet and vast tracks europe are blown away think feel something massive breakup country that spans 6th the planet bound have affects here course there also the humanitarian argument that democracies should help other democracies struggling democracies billion gift was that important our well being couldn raised voluntarilly people already give over 100 billion year charity despite the wishes libertarians this society far way and getting farther from being libertarian perhaps voluntary gifts would work had the proper framework but not have have face the problem now not years when have libertarian dream society right now there are huge stumbling blocks trade let alone charity there are still limitations high tech exports nasa can buy proton launch vehicles from them sure the market may able help great deal but can right now there are too many obstacles instead fighting against the aid you should fighting tear down the obstacles the market and charities have face seriously everyone has different opinions what stupid two causes are aid russia and strong space program someone else will champion welfare education doing studies drunken goldfish that why have republic and not true democracy instead gridlock massive scale only have gridlock congressional scale seems instead gridlock any scale have aid russia expensive space programs national charity that doesn help the poor and probably studies drunken goldfish think limited government more key than how democratic well think limited government primarily democratic due being limited but the main question how you transform state run economy and monolithic government into something that even remotely looks like ours btw sometimes seems that our government trying the opposite direction not going painless and not going easy simply cannot wait help when they have the proper government they never get there without the aid may too late already btw who decide stupid this just like those who want impose their morals others just the sort thing thought libertarians were against that was opinion and libertarians are very big free speech and just excercising mine actually politics are pretty libertarian except this one issue and this why impossible for join the party seems that libertarians want withdraw from the rest the world and let sink swim you are pretty libertarian except this one issue then you should very libertarian consider compromise how much money would your fellow russia aiders have give russia those you oppose weren using the same government machine steal money from you and your group for causes you don support also said above another problem have with transformation libertarian society not going happen painlessly overnight have seen nothing about how take our current government and society and turn into minimal government and responsible self sufficient populace could that 100 years ago but not now people have been saying that for hundreds years they didn have nuclear weapons 100 years ago nor instantaneous communications nor travel virtually anyplace the earth less than day like not are the beginnings global economy and global decision making all the more reason depend the free market which can more efficiently process information than depend rulers for decisions complex issues yes depend the rulers the free market and the businesses rulers emerge somewhere and they will never represent the opinions every person the planet there must checks and balances checks the government when gets out bounds and checks

happened _boomer_ what happened _boomer_ was that the judge didn allow the plaintiffs blackmail the cement plant demanding multi million dollar plant shut down over 185 000 damages and required the plant pay the plaintiffs the 185 000 make them whole the plant would never have been shut down the plaintiff lawyers would have just negotiated windfall settlement because the plaintiffs would prefer amount greater than 185k having the plant shut down while the plant would prefer any amount less than the value the plant have the plant continue operation everyone property rights were protected the plaintiffs were made whole unnecessary settlement costs were avoided okay now here interpretation _boomer_ based the facts presented the new york court appeals holding _boomer note the new york court appeals the highest court new york state while the united states and the fifty states call their highest court supreme court supreme judicial court supreme court appeals maryland and new york call theirs simply the court appeals make matters worse new york also calls its _second highest_ court the supreme court appellate division atlantic cement 219 257 870 1970 oscar boomer owned land near the atlantic cement company plant near albany the fact pattern gives information which came first the plaintiff acquisition the land defendant start production their cement plant the course its regular operations the cement plant did injury the plaintiffs property via dirt smoke and vibrations emanating from the plant the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief that they asked the court order atlantic cement stop damaging their property commentary this seems entirely reasonable boomer owned their property and presumably right quiet enjoyment atlantic cement actions were depriving boomer that right instead granting the plaintiffs request for injunction the court ordered them accept the damage being done their property provided that atlantic cement paid them 185 000 compensatory damages other words the court granted atlantic cement private party the power and authority _take_ the plaintiffs rights quiet enjoyment their property eminent domain taking eminent domain always problematical even when done the state allowing private firm opinion totally wrong yes know the _boomer_ court didn call eminent domain but walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks like eminent domain let take issue with the way you presented the case you say that what happened _boomer_ was that the judge didn allow the plaintiffs blackmail the cement plant demanding multi million dollar plant shut down over 185 000 damages blackmail pulls out black law dictionary abridged 5th edition blackmail unlawful demand money property under threat bodily harm injure property accuse crime expose disgraceful defects this crime commonly included under extortion statutes how you define blackmail one party act demanding the right set its own sale price for unique piece property which owns and which another party has expressed interest buying demanding the right not sell that property any price see boomer having found themselves the fortunate position owning something which atlantic cement had purchase wanted stay business had every right the world set whatever price they wanted there isn least shouldn any law that says that you have nice guy your private business dealings you say the plant would never have been shut down the plaintiff lawyers would have just negotiated windfall settlement because the plaintiffs would prefer amount greater than 185k having the plant shut down while the plant would prefer any amount less than the value the plant have the plant continue operation what since when are the courts supposed the business preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from other parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts those other parties atlantic cement didn want have face choice between paying windfall settlement going out business well shouldn atlantic cement have thought that before going _into_ business note that far the facts show boomer were _not_ the parties responsible for bringing about this situation that was atlantic cement own fault for choosing build and operate the type plant they did where and when they did and then you say everyone property rights were protected the plaintiffs were made whole unnecessary settlement costs were avoided above dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were made whole they were fact court action deprived their rights owners property choose sell not sell that property price acceptable them and for that deprivation they were _not_ made whole and again ask since when are the courts supposed the business ensuring that unnecessary settlement costs are avoided been miseducated always thought that the courts were supposed the business ensuring that justice done _boomer_ really being taught infamous that really sad because fail see how less than completely sensible you should read the law and economics stuff first hand instead filtered through teachers who clearly don like for whatever inexplicable reasons _boomer_ not being taught infamous least not school aside northeastern law usually does very good job hiring for their first year mandatory classes such torts where first encountered _boomer_ instructors who regardless their personal opinions can and teach the law neutrally when the students get into their second and third years which the students can pick and choose which courses take except for the mandatory professional responsibility course and are presumed bit more worldly and self confident less likely consciously sub consciously intimidated law school professors and able learn from openly biased instructors rather than indoctrinated them the instructors tend more open expressing their own opinions this especially true part time instructors who real life are practicing attorneys sitting judges this can _very_ educational sometimes far more than being taught somewhat cloistered scholar end aside called infamous because that opinion for the reasons stated above believe triumph something that can only call economic correctness over justice completely sensible only you believe that the alleged right the owners atlantic cement stay business and avoid losing lot their own money due their own wrongful act and the alleged right several hundred atlantic cement employees not have their jobs disappear should trump the rights people who own property which was damaged atlantic cement wrongful acts and you believe that correct for the courts any other branch government grant private parties the right take other people property eminent domain you like posner bill libertarian really didn know that what anything has had say about cases like _boomer_ course has too much paper trail ever nominated president democrat won like his antitrust stance republican won like his support gay marriage and bright law students shiver what they don understand easy imagine how the press will play baby selling seen mike godwin claim that posner asserts that law and economics applicable everything and the end all and all when posner says precisely the opposite goes admitted that understanding the field generally referred law and economics weak advocates the use economical analysis one many tie breaker factors which courts may use help them reach decisions cases which the dispute measured the scale justice evenly balanced fine but illustrated _boomer_ _not_ fine when the courts start viewing the economics case being more important

article 1483500352 igc apc org center for policy research cpr igc apc org writes from center for policy research cpr subject rejoinder questions israelis shaig think com subject ten questions israelis dear shai the answer first question concerning the nonexistence israeli nationality your answer conflicts with information have received from other quarters according which there are two distinct categories classifying israelis citizenship ezrahut and nationality the former used passports etc and the later for daily identification israeli society told that people israel have carry their cards all times and present them many public places almost every day these cards make clear who the holder jew arab you maintain that this mainly because religious services provided but you really believe that this the reason could you provide evidence that this the case and that serves other purpose number points you are making assumptions about the manner which the cards are used true law all residents citizens and tourists must carry form identification with them for citizens the standard the card the purpose this serves daily basis wherein they are presented public places for the purpose identifying the bearer this takes place banks cashing checks post offices registered mail and such etc quite frankly was rare that ever had present card for such activities more than once per week there law requirement that forces people wave their cards public furthermore none the services outlined discriminate against the bearer any manner having access this information the only case that can think which the field might taken into account during interaction with the police based upon the scenario general though arab citizens are clearly recognizable are non arabs your argument therefore becomes moot unless you can provide example how this field being used discriminate against them officially the answer second questions concerning the fact that israel has fixed borders you state that israel borders were shaped and reshaped both war and peace according what read the first zionists the beginning the century had plans for the jewish state extend into what lebanon and into transjordan jordan also read that was the express wish ben gurion not declare israel borders when israel was established this might restrict israel opportunities for later expansion israel often claims right existence the fact that jews lived there 2000 years ago that god promised the land them but according biblical sources the area god promised would extend all the way iraq and what were the borders biblical times which israel considers proper use today finally israel wants peace why can declare what considers its legitimate and secure borders which might base for negotiations having all the above facts mind one cannot blame arab countries fear israeli expansionism number wars have proved 1948 1956 1967 1982 take issue with your assertions think that arab countries know that they have nothing fear from israeli expansionism militarily israel not capable holding onto large tracts land under occupation hostile armed and insurgent population for sustained period time the intifada heavily taxing the israeli economy proof this can seen the israeli withdrawal from lebanon israeli troops pulled back from the awali and later from the litani order control the minimal strip needed keep towns out range katyusha missile fire public opinion israel has turned towards settling the intifada via territorial concessions the israel public sufferring from battle fatigue sorts and the gov aware with regards borders let state the following may not agree with the manner which negotiations are being held however the crux the matter that everyone either makes refrains from stating starting position the arab parties have called for total withdrawal and return pre borders israel were state large borders the negotiations might never get under way israel were state smaller borders then the arab countries might try and force even smaller borders during the negotiations think that leaving the matter settled negotiations and peace treaties infinitely more realistic and sensible your answer third question typical stalinist public official don think your answer honest you refer vanunu revelations about israel nuclear arsenal without evaluating the truthfullness his revelations now said the truth then why should been punished and lied why should punished would appreciate more honesty your statement typical the simple minded naivety center for policy research whether not all vanunu revelations were true has bearing the fact that some were for disclosing state secrets after having signed contracts and forms with the understanding that said secrets are not made public one should punished which were and which weren under moral obligation disclose that quite the reverse fact was taken court tried and found guilty you may take issue with number things but clearly you have understanding the concept secrets state something which every democratic govt has somebody provided answer the fourth question concerning hidden prisoners israeli prisons posted article from ariv documenting such cases seems that such prisoners exist israel what you think about that noticed that was documenting the fact that such prisoners could exist more than documented the fact that they exist the clu noted which you evidently did not pay attention that they know such reports cases sorry tell you but country mill tightly knit israel even the matter the arrest was not made public within relatively short time frame most people would know about own feelings are that the matter the arrest should made public unless court order issued allowing delay hours this would granted only judge could convinced that announcement would cause irreparable harm the ongoing investigation you imply that questions show bias and are formulated such way cast aspersions upon israel such terms have often been used the soviet union against dissidents they call the soviet union into disrepute questions are not disturbing they would not call forth such hysterical answers questions are clearly provocative but they are meant seek facts would very happy you could convince that what told about israel were just fabrications but alas you have failed suspect that you fear the truth and open and honest discussion this sign weakness not strength well sorry say that your questions are slanted such questions are often termed tabloid journalism and are not disturbing because they avoid any attempt objectivity such questions were often used during the mccarthy era basis for the witch hunts that took place then use your own example these questions might have been lifted from the format used stalinist prosecutors that were looking for small bits evidence that they could distort and portray larger and dirtier picture answers were not any more hysterical than the questions themselves the problem not that the were provocative was that they were selective their fact seeking you fall into the same category those who seek yes answers when the real answer sorts suspect that long the answers these questions not unequivocal you would remain unsatified and choose interprete them you see fit sign strength the ability look you remind those mistaken environmentalists who once advocated culling wolves because the cruelty deer only find that they had broken the food chain and wreaked havoc upon the very environment they sought protect the color blindness you exhibit true sign weakness hope you will muster the courage seek the full truth ditto shai guday stealth bombers software engineer thinking machines corp the winged ninja the skies cambridge

personality typing will discussed the beginning note set all followups sci med since most comments are more sci med oriented and sure most the replies any will med related article banschbach vms ocom okstate edu writes can not believe the way this thread candida yeast has progressed steve dyer and have been exchanging words over the same topic sci med nutrition when displayed his typical reserve and attacked woman poster for being treated licenced physician for disease that did not exist calling this physician quack was reprehensible steve and see that you and some the others are doing here well they are just responding their natural way hyper choleric syndrome hcs oops that not recognized illness the psychological community better not say that since therefore must not and never will exist actually fascinating that disproportionate number physicians will type out for those not familiar with the myers briggs system just mail and send summary file you the general population comprise only about the population but among physicians much much higher don know the exact percentage any help here one driving characteristic especially ntj their obvious choleric behavior driver type etc the extreme emotional need control lead and the best the most competent they are also extroverted they are best described field marshalls this trait very valuable and essential our society need people who want lead strive overcome the elements seek and thirst for knowledge raise the level competency etc the great successes science and technology are large part due the vision trait and scientifically minded approach trait the personality course the other types and temperaments have their own positive contributions well however when the person has self image challenges the dark side this personality type usually comes out which should obvious all physician who strong and who has not learned temper their temperament will extremely business like lack empathy feeling and very compelled have total control over their patient the patient must obedient their diagnosis and prescription without question known many this temperament and suffice say don oblige them with followup visit matter how competent think they are and they usually are very competent from knowledge viewpoint since that extreme drive theirs know the most know all maybe need more doctor enough this subject let move candida bloom let tell you who the quacks really are these are the physicans who have idea how the human body interacts with environment and how that balance can altered diet and antibiotics could just professional jealousy couldn help elaine jon but somebody else did you helped already your post course believe that have been misdiagnosed the net suffering from anal retentivitis but being the phlegmatic maybe was just little too harsh few people myself past posts let all try raise the level this discussion above the level anal effluent humans have all kinds different organisms living the system mouth stomach small and large intestine sinuses vagina and the skin these are nonpathogenic because they not cause disease people unless the immune system compromised they are also called nonpathogens because unlike the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease they not produce toxins they live out their merry existence and our body but any these organisms will considered pathogenic manages take residence within the body poor mucus membrane barrier can let this happen and vitamin mainly responsible for setting this barrier well described situation prior posts definitely was immune stressed blood tests showed vitamin levels were very low sinuses were mess doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged also was antibiotics times years the end even two weeks ceftin did not work and had confirmed diagnoses chronic bacterial infection the sinuses via cat scans mucus color won get into the details and other symptoms three very traditional ent made this diagnosis did not have any cultures done however because the difficulty doing this right and because other symptoms clearly showed bacterial infection enough this background provided help you understand where was when make comments about sporanox anti fungal therapy below the first question have this can fungus penetrate little way into poor mucus membrane tissue maybe via hyphae thus causing symptoms without being considered systemic the classic sense sort inbetween infection steve got real upset with elaine doctor because was using anti fungals and vitamin for her problems steve really understoood what vitamin does the body would not least should not calling elaine doctor quack was concerned too because the toxicity vitamin doctor after blood tests put 000 vitamin for one week only then dropped down 000 for the next couple weeks also received zinc and other supplementation since all these interrelate fairly complex ways doctor explained one those evil orthomolecular specialists had blood test three weeks later and vitamin was normal then stopped all vitamin except for some multi vitamin supplement and made sure that maintain 000 day beta carotene call carrot face hopefully elaine doctor will take similar careful approach and all supplements even reevaluating some supplements taking for example niacin fairly large dosages gram day which steve dyer had good information about sci med nutrition niacin only has second order improvement symptomatic relief sinus allergies then probably not worth taking such large dose long term and risking liver damage survives gets access lot glucose blooms and over rides the other organisms living with the sinuses tract vagina though now believe based successful therapy with sporanox that definitely had some excessive growth fungus unknown species sinuses still want ask the question have there been any studies that demonstrate candida blooms the sinuses with associated sinus irritation sinusitis rhinitis sinus irritation reduced significantly after one week sporanox and other new treatments were implemented during this time did not have any noticeable track problems before starting sporanox but some for few days after which then went away considered normal btw doctor dug out one his medical reference books sorry can remember which one and found obscure comment dating back into the 1950 which stated that people can develop contained non lethal non serious aspergillis infestations aspergiliosis the sinuses leading sinus inflammation symptoms have dig out that reference again since relevant this discussion some people really develop bad inflammatory process the mucus membrane skin bloom site whether this allergic like reaction the candida not isn certain doctor tested believe rast rast similar test for allergic response specificially candida albicans and showed strong positive another question would everybody show the same strong positive this test essentially useless and assuming true that candida can grow part way into the mucus membrane tissue and the concentration exceeds threshold amount could not person who tests having allergy candida definitely develop allergic symptoms such mucus membrane irritation due the body allergic response said earlier post one does not need rocket scientist have degree biochemistry see the plausibility this hypothesis btw and repost this again ivker his book sinus survival has routinely given before anything else nizoral pre sporanox systemic anti fungal not safe and not good sporanox his new chronic sinusitis patients they have been antibiotics four more times the last two years claims that out 2000 patients well over notice some relief sinus inflammation and other symptoms but doesn cure any means implying the called yeast fungus infection not the primary cause but later complication also found that nystatin whether taken internally put into sinus spray does not help this implies course assuming that excessive yeast fungus bloom aggravating the sinus inflammation that the yeast fungus has grown partway into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast fungus other than direct contact not absorbed into the blood stream again admit lots ifs and implies which doesn please the hard core who has have the double blind study non issue but one has start with some plausible hypothesis explanation strawman you will internal only symptoms can used and these symptoms are pretty nondescript this brings interesting observation used those who will deny and reject any and all aspects the yeast hypothesis until the appropriate studies are done and that you can observe culture the yeast bloom the gut sinus then there way diagnose even recognize the disease and know they realize that virtually impossible test for candida overbloom any part the body that cannot easily observed since candida everywhere the body real catch another catch those who totally reject the yeast hypothesis say that studies have been done actually studies have been done but not certain standard then from their perspective non study which should not even considered agree that the appropriate studies should done and that will take big right however order convince the funding agencies these austere times open their wallets you literally have give them evidence and the only acceptable evidence compete with other proposals paradoxically almost the exact study needed funding that you have the study before you even get funding scientist national lab very aware this for the smaller funded projects afraid that even ivker and 100 other doctors got together pooled their practice case histories and anecdotes into compelling picture and approach the funding agencies they would get nowhere even they were able publish their statistical results obvious from the comments some the doctors here that they have decided excessive yeast colonization the gut sinuses leading noticeable non lethal symptoms does not exist and not even tenable hypothesis any amount case histories compiled anecdotal evidence the contrary will never change their mind and not only that they would also oppose the needed studies because their minds done issue excessive yeast growth leading diffuse allergic symptoms does not will not and cannot exist period kind tough dialog with those who hold such viewpoint kind reminds lister candida kept check most people the normal bacterial flora the sinuses the tract mouth stomach and intestines and the vaginal tract which compete with for food the human immune system ususally does not bother itself with these nonpathogenic organisms unless they broach the mucus membrane barrier they inflammatory response will set most americans are not getting enough vitamin from their diets about all american die with less vitamin than they were born with autopsy studies while this low level vitamin does not cause pathology blindness does impair the mucus membrane barrier system this would then predisposing factor for strong inflammatory response after candida bloom aren there also other nutrients necessary the proper working the sinus mucus membranes and cilia while diabetics can suffer from candida bloom the most common cause this type bloom the use broad spectrum antibiotics which knock down many different kinds bacteria the body and remove the main competition for candida far food concerned while drugs are available handle candida many patients find that their doctor will not use them unless there evidence systemic infection the toxicity the anti fungal drugs does warrant some caution but the sinus inflammation suspected candida and recent use broad spectrum antibiotic the smoking gun then anti fungal use should approrpriate just the anti fungal creams are appropriate treatment for recurring vaginal yeast infections spite what steve dyer says again the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast fungus species can grow hyphae roots into deep tissue similar mold growing bread you can continue kill the surface such nystatin does but you can kill that which deeper the tissue without using systemic anti fungal such itraconazole sporanox some the older ones such nizoral which are more toxic and not effective this why has been pointed out recent studies sent doctor been mail contact with thanks that nystatin not effective the long term treatment tract candidiasis like trying weed garden cutting off what above the ground but leaving the roots ready come out again once you walk away the 60000 question whether contained candida bloom can partially grow into tissue through the mucus membranes causing some types symptoms susceptible people allergy without becoming systemic the classical sense the word something between strictly excessive bloom not causing any problems and the full blown systemic infection that potentially lethal the system the ano rectal region seems particularly good reservoir for candida and the use pantyhose many women creates very favorable environment around the rectum for transfer through moisture and humidity candida the vaginal tract one the most effctive ways minimmize this transfer wear undyed cotton underwear also one anal retentive like been diagnosed prior post that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth the bloom occurs the anal area the burning swelling pain and even blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids the bloom manages move further the tract very diffuse symptomatology occurs abdominal discomfort and blood the stool this positive stool for occult blood what sent elaine her family doctor the first place after extensive testing told her that there was nothing wrong but her gut still hurt another doctor and richard kaplan has told throiugh mail that considers occult blood tests stool specimens waste time and money because the very large number false positives candida blooms guys gut hurt constant basis would want fixed yes nice know that don have colon cancer but what then causing distress when finally find doctor who treats and gets better steve dyer calls him quack said private mail there are flaws our current medical system that make difficult even impossible for physician attempt alternative therapies after the approved proven accepted therapies don work for example went three ent who all said that will just have live with acute chronic sinusitis after the failed they did mention surgery open the ostia but ostia weren plugged and would not get the root cause condition after three months aggressive and fairly non standard therapy sporanox body nutrient level monitoring and equalization vitamin lentinen echinacea etc health has vastly improved where was two years ago before health greatly deteriorated course skeptics would say that maybe did nothing would have improved anyway but that view stretching things quite far because the experience the three ent saw who said that just have live with confident will reach what one could call total cure the anti fungal program undertook was one necessary step that direction because overuse for the last four years note for those having sinus problems may suggest the book ivker mention above sure get the revised edition have often wondered what with chronic distress sinus problems would about the problem that tells his patients non existent syndrome ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems and his visits several ent totally floored him when they said you just have live with spent several years trying everything standard and non standard until was essentially cured chronic sinusitis now shares his approach his book and can honestly say that the road recovery following some parts his one recommendation take systemic anti fungal the beginning treatment you have history anti biotic overuse has been proven him time and time again his own practice sure commented him the hard core beliefs the anti yeast hypothesis posters that would have definite things say such worked wonders for almost two thousand cases put mildly also would not surprised would say that they are the ones violating their moral obligations help the patient maybe those doctors who are reading this who have practice and are confronted patient having symptoms that could due the hypothetical yeast overgrowth they fit some the profiles the pro yeast people have identified should consider anti fungal therapy all other avenues have been exhausted remember theory and practice are two different things you cannot have one without the other they are synergistic doctor does something non standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief over thousand his patients shouldn you least sit and take notice maybe you ought trust what says and begin hypothesizing why works instead why shouldn work afraid lot doctors have become enamored with scientific correctness that they are ignoring the patients they have sworn help you have both both have balanced which don see from some the posters this group there comes point when you just have use little common sense and maybe empirical approach such trying good systemic anti fungal such sporanox after having exhausted all the other avenues was one those who the traditional medical establishment was not able help did the natural thing went couple doctor who are somewhat outside this establishment and result have found significant relief would not better the traditional medical establishment can set some kind mechanism where any doctor without fear being sued having his license pulled can try experimental and unproven beyond doubt therapies for his her patients that finally reach the point where all the accepted therapies are ineffective like hear doctor tell well tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted this country and since they clearly don work for you now have the authority use experimental unproven techniques that seem have helped others can promise anything and there are some risks you will have sign something saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature these unproven therapies and have register your case the state board anyway ent had suggested this would jumped this pronto instead going one those doctors who for either altruistic reasons for greed practicing these alternative therapies with much risk him her risk meaning losing their license and possibly the patient such mechanism would keep control the more mainstream medicine and also provide valuable data that would essentially free also would morally and ethically better than the current system showing the compassion the medical community the patient that doing everything can within reason help the patient the lack such mechanism that leading large numbers people try alternative therapies some which seem work like case and others which will never work all true quackery better get off soapbox before this post reaches 500k size taken orally can also become major bacteria the gut through aresol sprays has also been used innoculate the sinus membranes but before this innoculation occurs the mucus membrane barrier system needs strengthened this accomplished vitamin vitamin and some the complex vitamins diet surveys repeatedly show that americans are not getting enough and folate these are probably the segement the population that will have the greatest problem with this non existent disorder candida blooms after antibiotic therapy what dosage appears necessary promote the healing and proper working the mucos memebranes some the above material was obtained from natural healing mark bricklin published rodale press well notes from human nutrition course will posting discussion vitamin sometime the future along with reference citings point out the extremely important role that vitamin plays the mucus membrane defense system the body and why vitamin should effective dealing with candida blooms another effective dietary treatment restrict carbohydrate intake during the treatment phase this especially important the system involved candida can not get glucose not going out grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria which can use amino acids and fatty acids for energy chance take over and keep the candida check once carbohydrate returned the gut like see the role complex carbohydrates such starch steve and some the other nay sayers want jump all over this post fine jumped all over steve sci med nutrition because verbably accosted poster who was seeking advice about her doctor use

 |text from jek nih gov subject god morality and massacres lines 258 listmember andrew killie think wrote response the suggestion that genocide may sometimes the will god any god who works that way indescribably evil and unworthy worship faith nobuya higgy higashiyama replied substance did others where your source moral standards which you judge god behavior often argued that have standing which judge god actions who the clay talk back the potter but find contrary view scripture when god proposes destroy the city sodom genesis abraham says suppose that there are some good men the city will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked far from you lord such thing shall not the judge all the earth right told that the hebrew actually bit stronger than this and can perhaps better rendered dynamic equivalence shame you lord you such thing there are those who say that the definition good whatever god happens want but that then the statement that god good has meaning simply says that god does what wants that being the case one can either love obey god because good the only motive left for obeying him that powerful just makes sense obey dictator even when tells you round all jews and exterminate them because you defy him you might end the gas chamber yourself makes sense obey god because has the power punish you you don this ethical theory take radical contradiction genesis and christianity general any theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any further discussion morality the goodness god meaningless however does not follow that our moral judgements are always infallible particular cases still less our judgements particular cases about the course action most likely achieve good result when read the scriptural accounts the actions god history those actions often seem very different from what might expect god who loves and desires what best for moreover leaving the scriptures aside and considering the natural world find that nature often very different from what might expect were the work benevolent deity origen said those who believe that the author nature also the author the scriptures must expect find the scriptures the same sort difficulties that they find nature now that some such difficulties should exist not itself argument against the existence power wisdom and goodness god the contrary their absence would such argument suppose that watching bobby fisher play chess and suppose that every time makes move find myself nodding and saying good move just what was expecting him same move would have made were playing that would sign that fisher better chess player than myself given that better expect that least some his moves will have thinking now what suppose induced him that even boy that was real slip just thrown the game away similarly god understands the workings the universe better than expected that sometimes will look has made mistake one difference between fisher the chessboard and god the controls the universe that can see the end the chess game fisher wins revise earlier inference that was carelessness that made him lose his queen moves earlier however loses and particularly can see that there was time when had opportunity for checkmate two moves and did not take then know that not good player had thought with god the other hand shall not this life see the total result some his actions therefore grounds for judging that have seen bad move his part must always far shakier than grounds for making similar judgement about fisher the book genesis read that joseph ten older brothers who with good reason found him insufferable conspired sell him into slavery egypt there eventually became viceroy and when there was famine canaan was able provide for his family when his brothers nervously apologized told them not worry you meant evil but god turned into good once heard rabbi speak this text said the history the jews largely history events that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued survival the religion the people both but amazingly those events turn out the saving the jews and judaism the sale joseph his brothers looked like the breakup the family but fact ended with reconciliation the quarrel between them the famine that drove the family out canaan looked like misfortune for them but fact they had stayed canaan they would almost certainly have intermarried with the canaanites and been assimilated into their culture their oppression the egyptians few generations after their arrival egypt again looked like disaster but god used bring them out egypt and into the promised land here the people built temple and regularly offered sacrifices but the babylonians captured jerusalem and judea destroyed temple and city and countryside and deported most the people babylon you might have thought that that would the end the people and the religion but was not living canaan the people had been under constant danger assimilation again and again they had turned from the worship the lord the worship the canaanite fertility cults with their ritual prostitution and ritual human sacrifice the babylonian captivity put stop that never again did the jews show any interest polytheism idolatry neither the worship the canaanites mor that the babylonians ever again had foothold among them nor that all judaism had been danger becoming simply system sacrifices and temple observances the only prescribed acts worship consisted coming jerusalem every often and offering sacrifice during the captivity with the temple gone the jews invented the synagogue place meeting for reading and study and discussion the scriptures they came realize clearly what they were danger forgetting while they continued live judea that god not simply local tribal deity not just the controller the land canaan the patron the jewish people but the creator the world and the ruler and judge all humans everywhere time passed and the babylonian empire was replaced that the persians and then that the greeks rather the macedonians the ruler antiochus epiphanes was determined stamp out judaism and this end made the reading and the study the torah punishable death again one might think that this would the end judaism but was not the people met for worship and instead reading the torah portion appointed for the day they would read some passage from the prophets that had similar theme and then discuss that before this time the torah the called five books moses genesis exodus leviticus numbers and deuteronomy were the only books read and studied the synagogue had not been for antiochus the books the prophets would probably have been forgotten altogether his hatred for judaism saved them other examples here omitted for brevity sake some you may remember that julie andrews first became famous eliza doolittle the stage production fair lady when warner brothers undertook make movie everyone expected that julie who had been magnificent stage would play the same role the movie instead the studio decided with established screen star and cast audrey hepburn julie andrews was naturally crushed but she later realized that she had played the screen role she would have been type cast for life elize doolittle type would have been disaster for her was walt disney offered her the role mary poppins and she won oscar for the presentation she stood there smiling and looking walt disney she said and now special thanks the man who made all this possible jack warner was the most memorable line the evening similar spirit jews might thank the men who the providence god have preserved judaism and kept alive this day beginning with joseph brothers and continuing with two pharaohs with nebuchadnezzar with antiochus epiphanes after the formal meeting had broken one woman came him privately and said you were talking about the holocaust weren you answered that example that came your mind then you are right was talking about you but would not talk about everyone for not everyone can bear assume that meant that without the holocaust there would have been state israel someone hearing the rabbi lecture might leap the conclusion that god dependent the wickedness men accomplish his purposes least that the rabbi thought might then suppose that the wickedness fact god doing that stirred joseph brothers murderous hate against him and that when the israelites were egypt god hardened pharaoh heart that oppressed the people and would not let them and this raises questions about how action can considered wicked and the same time considered something that god has brought about suggest another way looking consider sculptor who has log wood from which proposes carve statue but the log instead having smooth even grain throughout has large knot that spoils the appearance the surface the sculptor considers the wood for while and then carves statue that features the knot that makes that particular interruption the grain and color the wood correspond some feature the statue that observers will say how fortunate the sculptor was finding piece wood with knot like that just the right place its presence the crowning touch the thing that makes the statue great work art reality the knot far from being what the sculptor was looking for was challenge his skill the wood had not contained that flaw would still have made great work art but different one joseph brothers had not sold him god would still have brought about his purposes for the jewish people but would have done another manner judas had not betrayed jesus caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected jesus but had rather acknowledged him the annointed god pilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set jesus free might appear that there would have been crucifixion and therefore redemption and therefore salvation not god did not need judas sin redeem judas had done right then god christ would still have reconciled the world himself not know how just not know how michelangelo would have painted the sistine chapel its interior had instead been shaped like grand central station and just not know how bobby fisher would have won his fourth game agianst spassky spassky had refused the exchange bishops and had attacked fisher knight instead don bother look the game question making this example but the point none the less valid thus may say both that god used say the cowardice pilate accomplish his purposes and that the said cowardice was not god doing and that pilate would not have thwarted god plans behaving justly and courageously what then are make the place where god says moses will harden pharaoh heart that will not let the people some christians have taken this mean that pharaoh was puppet with god pulling the strings and that his stubbornness and cruelty were not his own work but the work god him suppose rather that what god was telling moses was something like this you see that pharaoh not willing let the people not discouraged suppose that the situation out control purposes will not thwarted pharaoh chooses hear you and let the people well and good does not will fit his resistance into plans and fit perfectly that future historians and theologians will suppose that would have been thrown for loss pharaoh had obeyed return the question that started this all off possible that the serbs slaughtering the moslems bosnia are instruments god will first point what they are doing wrong just what joseph brothers did was wrong just what judas did was wrong they intend for evil god somehow brings good out that does not make them any less subject just condemnation and punishment second point course god will bring good out but not the same good that would have brought the serbians had refrained from the sins robbery and rape and murder nor does the good purposes excuse from the duty doing what right yours james kiefer

respects innocent lives tell tim what are these guerillas doing wrong assuming that they are using civilians for cover assuming also come brad are going get anywhere this any discussion doesn help bring elements never addressed nor commented any way made comment who right who wrong only that civilians are being used cover and that having been placed between the israelis and the guerillas they will injured both parties continue their fight pardon tim but not see how can possible for the idf fail detect the presence those responsible for planting the bomb which killed the three idf troops and then later know the exact number and whereabouts all them several villages were shelled how could the idf possibly have known that there were guerrillas each the targetted villages you see was arbitrary act retaliation the buffer zone prevent attacks israel not working why further neccessary for israeli guns pound lebanese villages why not just kill those who try infiltrate the buffer zone you see there more the shelling the villages called retaliation getting back getting even doesn make sense shell the villages the least shows reckless disregard the israeli government for the lives civilians agree with you here have always thought that israel bombing sortees and bombing policy stupid thoughtless inhumane and ineffective but there reason that israel should passive wait until attackers chose act there every reason believe that taking the fight the enemy will more stop attacks said previously israel spent several decades sitting passively its side border and only acting stop these attacks after the attackers had entered israeli territory didn work very well the host arab state did little nothing try and stop these attacks from its side the border with israel the number attacks were considerably higher was their physical and psychological impact the civilians caught their path the problem tim that the original reason for the invasion was palestinian attacks israel not lebanese attacks what the whole bit about attacks israel from neighboring arab states can start all over again while also hope for this happen will only occur when arab states show that they are prepared take the responsibility and the duty stop guerilla attacks israel from their soil they have prove provide some guaratees there way israel going accept their word not with their past attitude tolerance towards anti israel guerillas residence israel not willing accept the word others then imho has business wasting others time coming the peace talks this just another selectively applied statement the reason for this drawn out impasse between ababs palestinians and israelis that neither side willing accept the word the other your criteria everyone should stay away from the negotiations that precisely why the palestinians their recent pisga proposal for the interim period after negotiations and leading full autonomy are demanding conditions that essentially define autonomy already they not trust that israel will follow through the entire process and allow palestinians reach full autonomy you understand and accept this viewpoint the palestinians you then why should israel view arabs palestinians any different why should they trust the arab palestinians words since they don they are very reluctant give tangible assets land control areas exchange for words for this reason they are also concerned about the sorts guarantees they will have that the arabs will follow through their part any agreement reached first believe that statement applies both sides having said that think neccessary separate what legitimately negotiable and what not for example country has the right abuse one human rights deciding whether there will one two states palestine legitimate question while facto one state exists israel must treat all within its domain equitably tim you are ignoring the fact that the palestinians lebanon have been disarmed hezbollah remains the only independent militia hezbollah does not attack israel except few times such when the idf burned sheikh mosavi his wife and young son while the major armaments those allowing people wage civil wars have been removed the weapons needed cross border attacks still remain some extent rocket attacks still continue and commando raids only require few easily concealed weapons and refined disregard for human life yours that others such attacks also continue yes afraid that what you say true but that still does not justify occupying your neighbor land israel must resolve its disputes with the native palestinians wants peace from such attacks course israel would withdraw from lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn make the lebanese mad that bat guano the situation you call for existed the 1970s and attacks were commonplace not true lebanese were not attacking israel the 1970s with strong lebanese government free from syrian and israeli interference believe that the border could adequately patrolled the palestinian heavy weapons have been siezed past years and not see significant threat once existed please tim don fall into the trap treating lebanese and palestinians all part the same group there are too many who think all arabs all muslims are the same too many times have seen people support the bombing palestinian camps retaliation for idf death the hands the lebanese resistance the shelling lebanese villages retaliation for palestinian attack tim

aditives relevance animal studies human safety 1982 neurobehav toxicol teratol vol 455 462 sure peta would love hear your arguments tests have been done rhesus monkeys well have never seen study where the mode administration was intra ventricular the glu and asp were administered orally some studies used and intra ventricular not normal admin method for food tox studies for obvious reasons you must not have read the peer reviewed works that referred you would never have come with this brain injection bunk most certainly for neurotoxicology you know studies glutamate involve more than food science whose talking about food science what this comment supposed mean neurotoxicology and tratology brain research nature progress brain research all fine food science journals pardon but where are you getting this from have you read the journals have you done thorough literature search point the studies humans please familiar with the literature and never seen any which relate all olney work animals and the effects glutamate neurons then you would know that olney himself has casually referred chinese restaurant syndrome few articles why don you point some studies maybe then this exchange could productive the point exceeding the window course they amino acids note that people with pku cannot tolerate any phenylalanine well actually they have tolerate some phenylalanine essential amino acid they just try get little healthy without producing dangerous levels phenylalanine and its metabolites the blood they unable metabolise olney research compared infant human diets specifically the amount freely available glu mother milk versus commercial baby foods typical lunch items from the standard american diet such packaged soup mixes found that one could exceed the projected safety margin for infant humans least four fold single meal processed foods mother milk was well below the effective dose goodness not saying that good feed infants lot glutamate supplemented foods just that

studies psychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude and physiology suspect may arguing about separate things only adult sensitivities you and late occuring sequelae childhood ingestion and its implication for adults certainly the doses for excitotoxicity adults are considerably larger than for the young but the additivity glu and asp and their copious and increased presence modern processed foods jointly and their hidden presence hvp necessitates extreme caution why would anyone want eat compounds which have been shown markedly perturb the endocrine system adults the main point blood levels attained and oral doses would likely have greater than between who over what would most interested seeing you provide peer reviewed non food industry funded citations articles disputing that msg has effects whatsoever you mean asserting you being intellectually dishonest just plain confused because you conflating reports which not necessarily have anything with each other olney reports would argue potential for problems human infants but that not say that this says anything whatsoever about the use msg most foods nor does provide any studies humans which indicate any deleterious effects for obvious reasons says nothing about msg contribtion the phenomenon the chinese restaurant syndrome says nothing about the frequent inability replicate anecdotal reports msg sensitivity the lab olney work provides putative causal mechanism for some sensitivities terry epelbaum and martin have shown that orally administered msg causes changes normal gonadotropic hormone

himself heaven the contrary are all sinners and are all guilty before god written there none righteous not one there none that understandeth there none that seeketh after god romans the heart deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know jeremiah such wicked person god sight what will god the bible teaches that the end the world all the wicked will come under eternal punishment place called hell for fire kindled mine anger and shall burn unto the lowest hell and shall consume the earth with her increase and set fire the foundations the mountains will heap mischiefs upon them will spend mine arrows upon them they shall burnt with hunger and devoured with burning heat and with bitter destruction will also send the teeth beasts upon them with the poison serpents the dust deuteronomy come now hell not real surely things are not that bad indeed hell very real and things are that bad for the individ ual who does not know the lord jesus christ savior the bible makes many references hell indicating that both eternal and consists perpetual suffering and whosoever was not found written the book life was cast into the lake fire revelation shall the end the world the angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just and shall cast them into the furnace fire there shall wailing and gnashing teeth matthew when the lord jesus shall revealed from heaven with his mighty angels flaming fire taking vengeance them that know not god and that obey not the gospel our lord jesus christ who shall punished with everlasting destruction from the presence the lord and from the glory his power thessalonians that terrible why would god create hell hell terrible and exists because god created man accountable god for his actions god perfect justice demands payment for sin for the wages sin death romans for must all appear before the judgment seat christ that every one may receive the things done his body according that hath done whether good bad corinthians but say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof the day judgment matthew does that mean that the end the world everyone will brought life again judged and then sent hell indeed does that unless can find someone our substitute bearing the punishment eternal damnation for our sins that someone god himself who came earth jesus christ bear the wrath god for all who believe him all like sheep have gone astray have turned every one his own way and the lord hath laid him the iniquity all isaiah but was wounded for our transgressions was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement our peace was upon him and with his stripes are healed isaiah for delivered unto you first all that which also received how that christ died for our sins according the scriptures and that was buried and that rose again the third day according the scriptures corinthians for hath made him sin for who knew sin that might made the righteousness god him corinthians are you saying that trust christ substitute who was already punished for sins then will not have worry about hell anymore yes this have believed christ savior then have already stood before the judgment throne god christ substitute has already paid for sins that believeth the son hath everlasting life and that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath god abideth him john but what does mean believe him agree with all that the bible says about christ savior then saved from going hell believing christ means whole lot more than agreeing our minds with the truths the bible means that hang our whole lives him means that entrust every part our lives the truths the bible means that turn away from our sins and serve christ our lord man can serve two masters for either will hate the one and love the other else will hold the one and despise the other cannot serve god and mammon matthew repent therefore and converted that your sins may blotted out when the times refreshing shall come from the presence the lord acts are you saying that there other way escape hell except through jesus what about all the other religions will their followers also hell yes indeed they cannot escape the fact that god holds account able for our sins god demands that pay for our sins other religions cannot provide substitute bear the sins their followers christ the only one who able bear our guilt and save neither there salvation any other for there none other name under heaven given among men whereby must saved acts jesus said the way the truth and the life man cometh unto the father but john confess our sins faithful and just forgive our sins and cleanse from all unrighteousness john now desperate not want hell what can you must remember that god the only one who can help you you must throw yourself altogether the mercies god you see your hopeless condition sinner cry out god save you and the publican standing afar off would not lift much his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying god merciful sinner luke sirs what must saved and they said believe the lord jesus christ and thou shalt saved acts but how can believe christ know little about him wonderfully god not only saves through the lord jesus but also gives the faith believe him you can pray god that will give you faith jesus christ your savior for grace are saved through faith and that not yourselves the gift god ephesians god works particularly through the bible give that faith you really mean business with god about your salvation you should use every opportunity hear and study the bible which the only word god this brochure all verses from the bible are within indented paragraphs give heed them with all your heart then faith cometh hearing and hearing the word god romans but does this mean that have surrender everything god yes god wants come him total humility acknowledging our sinfulness and our helplessness trusting totally him the sacrifices god are broken spirit broken and contrite heart god thou wilt not despise psalm because are sinners love our sins therefore must begin pray god for intense hatred our sins and sincerely desire salvation will also begin turn from our sins god strengthens know that our sins are sending hell unto you first god having raised his son jesus sent him bless you turning away every one you from his iniquities acts doesn the bible teach that must attend church regularly and baptized will these save possible should these things but they will not save work any kind can secure our salvation salvation god sovereign gift grace given according his mercy and good pleas ure salvation not works lest any man should boast ephesians what else will happen the end the world those who have trusted jesus their savior will transformed into their glorious eternal bodies and will with christ forever more for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with shout with the voice the archangel and with the trump god and the dead christ shall rise first then which are alive and remain shall caught together with them the clouds meet the lord the air and shall ever with the lord thessalonians what will happen the earth that time god will destroy the entire universe fire and create new heavens and new earth where christ will reign with his believers forever more but the day the lord will come thief the night the which the heavens shall pass away with great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall burned nevertheless according his promise look for new heavens and new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness peter does the bible give any idea when the end the earth will come yes the end will come when christ has saved all whom plans save and this gospel the kingdom shall preached all the world for witness unto all nations and then shall the end come matthew can know how close the end the world might yes god gives much information the bible concerning the timing the history the world and tells that while the day the lord will come thief the night for the unsaved will not come thief for the believers there much evidence the bible that the end the world and the return christ may very very close all the time clues the bible point this for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them travail upon woman with child and they shall not escape thessalonians surely the lord god will nothing but revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets amos but that means judgment day almost here yes does god warned ancient nineveh that was going destroy that great city and gave them forty days warning and jonah began enter into the city day journey and cried and said yet forty days and nineveh shall overthrown jonah what did the people nineveh from the king down they humbled themselves before god repented their sins and cried god for mercy but let man and beast covered with sackcloth and cry mightily unto god yea let them turn every one from his evil way and from the violence that their hands who can tell god will turn and repent and turn away from his fierce anger that perish not jonah did god hear their prayers yes god saved great many people nineveh can still cry god for mercy that will not come into judg ment yes there still time become saved even though that time has become very short how shall escape neglect

statement believe that gods exist does rest upon faith that you are making positive statement that gods exist strong atheism rather than merely saying don know and therefore don believe them and don not believe then weak atheism once again not believe god different than saying believe that god does not exist still maintain the position even after reading the faqs that strong atheism requires faith the way usually used view you are saying here that driving car requires faith that the car drives not saying this all requires faith part say the car drives because seen drive done more than fact actually driven now what does require some faith the belief that senses give accurate representation what out there but there evidence pro con for the existence non existence god see what have say below this for conclusion and have more faith than have the premises and the argument used sorry remain skeptical don believe entirely conclusion that you have seen evidence that there god correct neither have but lack evidence for the existence something way evidence for the non existence something the creationist have similar mode argumentation which they disprove evolution the establish creation you personally have never seen neutrino before but they exist the pink unicorn analogy breaks down and rather naive have scientific theory that explains the appearance animal life evolution when draw the conclusion that pink unicorns don exist because haven seen them this conclusion has foundation observation and theory pink unicorn did exist would qualitatively similar other known entities that say since there good evidence that all life earth has evolved from more primitive ancestors these pink unicorns would share common anscestory with horses and zebras and such god however has such correspondence with anything imo there physical frame work observation draw any conclusions from but first let say the following might have language problem here regards faith and existence christian maintain that god does not exist exist means have being space and time god does not have being god being kierkegaard once said that god does not exist eternal with this said feel rather pointless debate the called existence god and that not what doing here believe that god the source and ground being when you say that god does not exist also accept this statement but obviously mean two different things however what follows will use the phrase the existence god usual sense and this the sense that think you are using would like clarification upon what you mean the existence god that word game disagree with you profoundly this haven defined god existence fact haven defined god but this might getting off the subject although you think relevant can come back further saying god existence either waste time existence already used and there need replace god you are implying more with which case your definition and your argument far are incomplete making fallacy you are using wrong categories here perhaps you misunderstand what saying making argument what ever and offering definition there fallacy not trying convince you anything believe and that rests upon faith and inappropriate apply the category logic this realm unless someone tells you that they can logically prove god that they have evidence then the use logic disprove their claims fine and necessary btw incomplete argument not fallacy some things are not even wrong deletion one can never prove that god does does not exist when you say that you believe god does not exist and that this opinion based upon observation will have ask what observtions are you refering there are observations pro con that are valid here establishing positive belief deletion where does that follow aren observations based the assumption that something exists don follow you here certainly one can make observations things that they didn know existed still maintain that one cannot use observation infer that god does not exist such positive assertion requires leap and wouldn you say there level definition that the assumption god meaningful not would reject that concept anyway where your evidence for that god meaningful some level once again you seem completely misunderstand have evidence that god meaningful any level maybe such response you gave just comes naturally you because many people try run their own private conception god down your throat however not doing this arguing one and only one thing that make positive assertion about something for which there can principle evidence for against requires leap requires faith you would say theist however there form atheism that can respect but must founded upon honesty benedikt bob singleton bobs thnext mit edu

biblical contradictions fallaciously answered judas date thu apr 1993 can basically restrict this post showing the type evidence decenso has presented and answering his two questions and couple his spurious insults and false claims reply the way decenso you really should have looked the index your bauer arndt gingrich greek lexicon you would have found that the word acts for lot kleros not chorion stated archer and nowhere the very large discussion kleros done the theological dictionary the new testament bromley the meaning burial plot discussed discusses the forms kleros kleros kleroo etc and the various meanings kleros plot land and inheritance but mentions nothing about chorion burial plot why does this not surprise thus would seem very good thing you dumped archer reference later corrected himself _____________________________________________________________________ from daveb pogo tek com dave butler newsgroups talk religion misc subject new biblical contradictions fallaciously answered judas date fri apr 1993 owe the group apology habit check articles before and after their submission for errors last article stated the way decenso you really should have looked the index your bauer arndt gingrich greek lexicon you would have found that the word acts for lot kleros not chorion stated archer and nowhere the very large discussion kleros done the theological dictionary the new testament bromley the meaning burial plot discussed discusses the forms kleros kleros kleroo etc and the various meanings kleros plot land and inheritance but mentions nothing about chorion burial plot why does this not surprise thus would seem very good thing you dumped archer reference was wrong admit that not have handle greek grammar and thus confused kleros the second last word acts being the plot land discussed actuality chorion which the last word acts unfortunately greek dictionary does not discuss chorion cannot report the nuances the word don know someone else would have caught this though sure that someone would able but have aversion disseminating mistakes especially when someone else might use that mistake prove point _____________________________________________________________________ reply vary noble you dave didn want have number sources show you wrong although researching chorion little course the only other reference decenso has given bullinger and bullinger uses such ridiculous exegisis that when accused decenso actually believing bullinger replied that misquoted him and you maintain that you find such exegesis convincing dear reply your misquotes are astounding dave read the beginning this part response see what really said posting this article actually decenso you said that there was benefit our argument that caused rediscover bullinger exegisis did not realize that you would find such garbage beneficial unless you were convinced reply thank you for correcting your restating points and decenso also replied dave these are not necessarily views they are bullinger will discuss the land issue later posts sure only responding this one you have directed bullinger views because enjoyable thus apologize for thinking that even decenso could find such drek convincing should specify which parts bullinger finds convincing and quit hiding behind disingenuous mask this what bullinger believed not necessarily what believe which decenso you find the exegisis convincing not reply one purposes debating these alleged contradictions with you and others diseminate many different views possible reconciliations raised various bible scholars and students alike when present views will clearly distinguish them from now course without archer and bullinger find that decenso has presented greek exegisis all and decenso has made big thing about not referring back the actual greek thus find this demand his part for quality greek exegisis hypocritical requirement reply good point but your declaring that these passages are contradictory you have produced only superficial reasonings and observations nor have you dug deeper glad you have begun this post will begin greek studies these passages more depth than thought necessary well would appropriate look what decenso has actually used evidence now know what claims for standard has stated often enough the text itself parallel passages other pertinent scriptures historical context historical content other pertinent historical info cultural context cultural content other pertinent cultural info grammatical construction hebrew and greek word studies etc but are these actual standards has used simply empty hyperbole let see has used and since trying reconcile other passages see that has also used the other hand has presented use historical context historical content other pertinent historical info cultural context cultural content other pertinent cultural info grammatical construction even hebrew and greek word studies remember archer and bullinger don count thus find his vaunted criteria for exegisis just empty mouthings reply question you find such criteria important you plan starting use them the best your ability will you continue present shallow observations don mean this bad way this point our _debates_ have not found necessary present total exegetical analysis these passages since seem keep beating around the bush and not getting into the core the verses not believe necessary use many the above criteria refute your arguments judas acts and matthew but will best from this point use several the above criteria since you desire hope you will also will greatly enhance our study these passages the only thing has actually used beyond the passage itself any other passage thus decenso should honest and note that most his list red herring and his only real criteria seems the text itself parallel passages reply the reason simple you are mistating the passages you claim that the passages contradict one another not see the passages contradicting one another they may very well complimentary many scholarly sources mention matthew may not presenting judas death you claim but look your defense this later also the reward iniquity the acts passage may not the pieces silver matthew passages although you have valiant attempt later stating why you believe this beginning stages our debates are laying some scriptural groundwork which will expanded upon through deeper exegesis course the only reason can see drastically reinterpret passage has done with judas death make agree with another passage that both could considered correct reply one the reasons have given different exegetical view the passages that you seem think the majority scholarship wrong concluding these passages are complimentary however see problem tony rose explanation judas death _____________________________________________________________________ how would you explain the inaccuracy between judas hanging himself matthew and falling headlong burst open this question the manner which judas died one with which are constantly confronted our travels many people point the apparent discrepancy the two accounts obvious irreconcilable error some have gone far say that the idea inerrant bible destroyed these contradictory accounts however this not the case all matthew relates that judas hanged himself while peter tells fell and was crushed the impact the two statements are indeed different but they necessarily contradict each other matthew does not say that judas did not fall neither does peter say that judas did not hang himself this not matter one person calling something black and the other person calling white both accounts can true and supplementary possible reconstruction would this judas hanged himself tree the edge precipice that overlooked the valley hinnom after hung there for some time the limb the tree snapped the rope gave way and judas fell down the ledge mangling his body the process the fall could have been before after death either would fit this explanation this possibility entirely natural when the terrain the valley hinnom examined from the bottom the valley you can see rocky terraces feet height and almost perpendicular there are still trees around the ledges and rocky pavement the bottom therefore easy conclude that judas struck one the jagged rocks this way down tearing his body open important remember that are not told how long judas remained hanging from the tree how advanced was the decomposition his body before his fall louis gaussen relates story man who was determined kill himself this individual placed himself the sill high window and pointed pistol his head then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window the same time the other hand person could say that this man took his life shooting himself while another could rightly contend committed suicide jumping form the tall building this case both are true both are true the case matthew and peter accounts the death judas merely situation different perspectives the same event _____________________________________________________________________ your only reason for rejecting this believe your attempt discredit inerrancy you haven related how this impossible highly unlikely here what you said earlier post _____________________________________________________________________ quoting tony rose there are still trees around the ledges and rocky pavement the bottom therefore easy conclude that judas struck one the jagged rocks this way down tearing his body open important remember that are not told how long judas remained hanging from the tree how advanced was the decomposition his body before his fall the added text this version heavy that assuming you are truly opposed such tactics you should find not credible but you seem find tony rose eisegesis satisfactory while clearly rejecting david joslin _____________________________________________________________________ here you discredit tony explanation based what you deem too heavy for the passages but you haven addressed why you feel that way you can say vain attempt reconcile the contradiction but that doesn tell didn happen nor have you shown why you reject that possibility questions matthew lying luke lying are they both lying are either both them misinformed why you think there such alleged contradiction not think you have ever told what you believe this respect present though decenso only asks two questions you claim acts and matthew contradict one another representing judas death ask you again provide evidence that matthew stated judas died the hanging you claim that the pieces silver matthew that judas threw down the temple and the chief priests used the reward iniquity acts that pictures judas some way purchasing field with therefore there contradiction prove that the pieces silver and the reward iniquity are one and the same actually find question rather stupid request but will answer because now restricts himself two points first would point out that hanging very efficient manner for ending life fact bit fluke when someone survives hanging except fantasy cowboy movies and even then usually referred attempted hanging reply work agency that investigates child abuse and neglect today got call child that attempted suicide hanging himself because his mother crack failed his attempt and child psych ward local hospital hanging attempts are not always successful assume that because most hangings are successful this one was also begging the question may quote you last night listening _the bible answer man_ broadcast the christian research institute show one the scholars there used several these terms that you use not all that familiar with them the man the bam show teaches comparative religion and logic was interesting this prevalent that that say man hung himself with other qualifiers synonymous with stating that killed himself reply qualifiers are important times see passage mention below does hanging always have this outcome did matthew who the only source have judas hanging himself state that judas died result say synonymous means has the same meaning boy age hung himself but lived this only one probably thousands documented cases can discover now not alone this thought fact since decenso respects christian scholarly including greek scholars opinion did some research reply thank you dave interestingly not one the christian references read interpreted the hanging being anything but fatal suicide reply above mine use christian sources back your points what about tony position you value even consider valid possibility also possible that the sources you read may wrong lying deceived other parts their books should have done with archer toss them the side and not value anything they say including their interpretation the hanging judas sure _you_ would find some errors and maybe even some deception those sources you also noted they interpreted the hanging meaning died although that very possibly true you find that the text itself remember that the first criteria must examine this included the biblical knowledge commentary woodward and zuck reply which own good source commentary info but not inerrant the interpreters volume commentary the bible laydon the one volume bible commentary dunelow word meanings the testament ralph earl the abingdon bible commentary published abingdon harpers bible commentary william neal actually could have presented many more well reply appreciate your doing this research dave maybe are getting somewhere how both should approach these alleged contradictions more depth study each case these references specifically describe that the interpretation matt successful suicide and thus can only conclude that the greek word apagchw hang oneself translated successful hanging reply above mine you can only conclude this although tony says this was highly probable outcome but matthew does not state death being result the greek word apagcho matthew only occurrence the new testament the septuagint the greek translation the used the time jesus only used samuel now when ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed saddled donkey and arose and went home his house his city then put his household order and hanged himself and died and was buried his father tomb notice that not only stated that ahithophel hanged himself sept apagcho but explicitly adds and died here have doubt the result matthew are not explicitly told judas died also there nothing the greek suggest success failure simply means hang oneself but decenso you are more than welcome disagree and show more reputable christian scholars that insist that the hanging was not successful reply above mine reputable you mean ones that have never erred far insisting that the hanging was unsuccessful that can done even said earlier post _____________________________________________________________________ although still agree with tony exegesis being the most probable explanation regarding judas death taking into account several criteria recently noticed some new things matthew mat then threw down the pieces silver the temple and departed and went and hanged himself but the chief priests took the silver pieces and said not lawful put them into the treasury because they are the price blood and they consulted together and bought with them the potter field bury strangers therefore that field has been called the field blood this day first all notice that the text does not say that judas died result hanging all says that went and hanged himself luke however acts tells that and falling headlong burst open the middle and all his entrails gushed out this pretty clear indication along with the other details given acts peter speech the need pick new apostle etc that least after judas fall was dead the whole concept that matthew and luke both recount judas death highly probable but not clear cut _____________________________________________________________________ also wrote _____________________________________________________________________ reply here have stickler dave that have say just recently noticed let look the passage matthew mat saying have sinned betraying innocent blood and they said what that you see mat then threw down the pieces silver the temple and departed and went and hanged himself mat but the chief priests took the silver pieces and said not lawful put them into the treasury because they are the price blood mat and they consulted together and bought with them the potter field bury strangers mat therefore that field has been called the field blood this day notice verse then went and hanged himself matthew does not say judas died does should assume died result the hanging what does acts say act now this man purchased field with the wages iniquity and falling headlong burst open the middle and all his entrails gushed out act for written the book psalms let his dwelling place desolate and let one live and let another take his office here may have graphic explanation judas death line reasoning dispel your contradiction myth the two accounts judas death this matthew doesn necessarily explain how judas died does say judas hanged himself but didn specifically say judas died the hanging incident however acts seems show his graphic demise therefore there contradiction between matthew and acts judas death reply know from matthew that did hang himself and acts probably records his death although possible and plausible that fell from the hanging and hit some rocks thereby bursting open can longer assume that the case therefore contradiction matthew did not say judas died result the hanging did most scholars believe probably did but ______________________________________________________________________ quoted all that show that highly regard the scholars explanations but looking the texts initially can assume judas died however highly probable the way while all agree that judas died from the hanging the books had different ways dealing with the contradiction are discussing one simply ignored entirely and simply referred back matthew version the correct version both matt and acts the biblical knowledge commentary suggested the hypotheses that judas hung and then when rotted his belly exploded which doesn explain his headlong fall that his branch rope broke and fell his death and his gut gushed out which doesn explain how hanging man would fall headlong rather than feet first reply the outcome any fall dependent upon many factors how high the person was suspended before the fall any obstructions such tree branches that may have deviated the fall how steep incline rocky surfaces the victim fell upon thus possibly rolling bouncing several rocks etc superficial examination the acts passage and the matthew passage are not given lot info the geographical specifics but tony the above quoted post gave some _____________________________________________________________________ possible reconstruction would this judas hanged himself tree the edge precipice that overlooked the valley hinnom after hung there for some time the limb the tree snapped the rope gave way and judas fell down the ledge mangling his body the process the fall could have been before after death either would fit this explanation this possibility entirely natural when the terrain the valley hinnom examined from the bottom the valley you can see rocky terraces feet height and almost perpendicular there are still trees around the ledges and rocky pavement the bottom therefore easy conclude that judas struck one the jagged rocks this way down tearing his body open _____________________________________________________________________ now truthfully not see what comforting about matthew confusing the source the potter field prophesy but the other hand the author correct matthew does make that confusion course biblical inerrantist who claim that every word the bible guaranteed true god will have thereby add one more contradiction the death judas where the prophesy the potter field came from reply please when are done with this study his death remind discuss this with you your second question decenso you ask how could sure that the money with which judas purchased the land was indeed for the betrayal rather than some other source would point out that acts where specifically mention the reward iniquity acts also specifically mentions what act iniquity they were talking about acts concerning judas who was guide those who arrested jesus now would point out that when the bible describes act iniquity and then immediately discusses the reward iniquity would rather inane suggest that was action iniquity other than the one discussed reply dave are getting somewhere aren act and those days peter stood the midst the disciples altogether the number names was about hundred and twenty and said act men and brethren this scripture had fulfilled which the holy spirit spoke before the mouth david concerning judas who became guide those who arrested jesus act for was numbered with and obtained part this ministry act now this man purchased field with the wages iniquity and falling headlong burst open the middle and all his entrails gushed out act and became known all those dwelling jerusalem that field called their own language akel dama that field blood act for written the book psalms let his dwelling place desolate and let one live and let another take his office notice that verse the word iniquity not used rather states that judas became guide those who arrested jesus but the writer did not stop there for was numbered with and obtained part this ministry what part did judas play their ministry joh this said not that cared for the poor but because was thief and had the money box and used take what was put joh for some thought because judas had the money box that jesus had said him buy those things need for the feast that should give something the poor now know what part judas played was treasurer per right after peter stated that judas played part this ministry treasurer according john then luke adds the parenthetical explanation wages iniquity money that should have been put into the ministry but was stolen judas purchase field believe this better exegetical explanation what the wages iniquity are what you think dave now since have given you clear answers and even references perhaps you could unequivocally state what type inerrantist you are instead asking what type think you are you did joslin reply will gladly admit that complete inerrantist although not have that big problem with the limited inerrancy view frank one wished contend with him could not answer him one time out thousand job

wrong tomb the facts are these first far know there was other tomb nearby which mistake they could have gone second contrary all similar experience for three more people forget the place where they have buried their dearest loved one within less than three days even the women did miss the tomb when peter and john came did they too the wrong tomb third were the soldiers guarding the wrong tomb there course record attempt escape the evidence the empty tomb the new testament itself now when they were going behold some the watch came into the city and showed unto the chief priests all the things that were done and when they were assembled with the leaders and had taken counsel they gave large money unto the soldiers saying say his disciples came night and stole him away while slept and this come the governor ears will persuade him and secure you they took the money and did they were taught and this saying com monly reported among the jews until this day matthew this good illustration many later attempts escape the fact that the tomb was empty you will notice once that the chief priests and the elders never questioned but that the tomb was empty they never even went out see what the guards had reported was true they knew was true another fact about this story makes ridiculous maintain that the tomb was empty the soldiers were told say that jesus disciples came and stole the body away while they the soldiers were asleep how could they know what was going while they were asleep obviously such testimony would valueless any court even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make reject the explanation the very character and the later history the disciples compel believe they did not steal and secretly carry away the body jesus first professor heffern points out the leaders judaism jerusalem who had put the lord jesus death had nothing offer contradict these disciples they continued preach jesus and his resurrection because all jerusalem knew the tomb was empty there had been trickery here sooner later would have been suspected then proved second surely one the disciples even most them would have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent may possible live lie but men seldom die for lie and most these men did the result ultimately would have been that the message that christ had risen would have suffered the fate all such unfounded stories would have lost power instead this truth swept the world closed pagan temples won millions disciples brought hope despairing humanity was the very foundation truth the early church and today believable and freshly glorious ever but not only did jesus come alive again did not disappear leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days what had happened him instead appeared them literally visibly frequently appeared the women the tomb resurrection morning matthew later that day mary magdalene alone john and simon peter also alone luke the afternoon walked with two his followers toward emmaus luke and that night appeared ten the apostles gathered together upper room jerusalem mark luke etc week later appeared all eleven the apostles probably the same place john once was seen above 500 brethren mountain galilee corinthians and finally the apostles just before his ascension mark luke acts with the fact the empty tomb regard these histor ically recorded appearances all kinds theories have been proposed attempting deny their literalness but these theories are unreasonable without supporting evidence none has ever won the unanimous approval those who refuse believe the reality the appearances moreover while true are living age when may our leading scientists and agnostics and many our philosophers are antisuperanaturalistic let not forget that some the greatest thinkers the ages have firmly believed this great miracle increase mather president harvard timothy dwight president yale nathan lord president dartmouth edward hitchcock president amherst mark hopkins president williams john witherspoon president princeton these men and countless others have believed but suppose christ did rise from the dead what what has with life what has with your life just this seals with certitude the teachings christ jesus taught many great truths especially many about himself claimed have come down from god said was the way god said was the son god who alone knew god perfectly said that whoever believed him had eternal life and one else had said that whatever ask god his name would grant thus when did rise from the grave the third day revealed that these amazing unparalleled predictions spoke the truth you know any reason any good reason why should not believe that his words are all true the point does not the truth the resurrection convince that none other than the one claimed the son god and then course the fact that christ rose from the dead testifies that has broken the power death and that will some day raise also from the grave promised other words this person jesus christ the son god all this should the cornerstone the foundation your life for said life built him would know forgiveness sins his compan ionship and help joy that circumstances can ever take away and hope that shineth more and more unto perfect day those who have tried down through the ages and there have been many have given their testimony and today who believe also know

his evidently specious claims continue post periodically until answers them publicly indicates that won answer them stops posting alt atheism the alt atheism community tells stop get totally bored apologize for the somewhat juvenile nature this approach but loss figure out another way crack his intransigence and seeming intellectual dishonesty this post charley can help but notice that you have still failed provide answers substantive questions that have been raised response your previous posts submit that you don answer them because you cannot answer them without running afoul your own logic and once again challenge you prove wrong make the task easy for you possible present concise statements some the questions that you have failed answer the hope that you may address them one time for all see should you fail answer again within reasonable time period will post this article with suitable additions and deletions such time that notice post you another topic will repeat this procedure until you either address the outstanding challenges you cease post this newsgroup would like apologize advance you have answered any these questions previously and your answer missed notice you can kind enough post mail such articles will only too pleased publicly rescind the challenge question and remove from this list now the questions after claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological patterns that you proposed then semi retracting that claim stating that you weren referring all atheists asked you name some atheists who you feel don fit your patterns show that you indeed were not referring all atheists that you are aware you failed please now question can you name any posters who not fit into your stereotype here the context for the question this not true for everyone this board and you are out line assuming that you however deleted the text further along where said that didn mean imply that everybody experience was along the same lines whether not you mean make such implications you repeatedly allow approach the issue from another viewpoint can you name those atheists that you come across who not fit into the patterns that you theorize you have taken umbrage statements the effect that senses and reason are all have and when pressed you have implied that have alternative called revelation have repeatedly asked you explain what revelation and how one can both experience and interpret revelation without doing via our senses and reason you failed please now question can you explain what revelation and how one can experience and interpret without using senses and inherent reasoning here the context for the question revelation not reason and have revelation then reasoning not all have first show that revelation exists second revelation not perceived through the senses how exactly perceived according webster revelation act revealing communicating divine truth now tell how such thing can revealed communicated other than via the senses tell how you can interpret this revelation other than with reason that using your brain interpret what you are sensing when say there way for human being interface with the universe other than via the senses interpreted reason your brain because this the simple truth you have another mechanism interface all means share with then later you cannot escape the fact that our entire interface with the universe our senses and our reason period again this indefensible simple truth challenge you show otherwise then later few mystics will agree this assertion and the common defense redefining senses absorb for instance mystical experiences begs the question whether some senses are better than others allow you the broadest definition senses make things easier for you now show that mystical experiences exist remember you aren allowed testimony others mystics since you have dismissed testimony unreliable you know tainted own bias further once these mystical thingies are absorbed show evidence that human can recognize and respond them short interpretation via that person reasoning capabilities challenge you show these things you cannot you might well give the fight then later let reiterate you have not explained your interpretation your experiences not possible for have attacked them point fact specifically challenged you explain this revelation stuff that you were talking about and note for the record that you appear have declined challenge what how sensed how interpreted and how does this sensing and interpretation occur without the conduit our senses and reasoning abilities you have answered none these questions that straight the heart your claims you can answer them your claims are entirely specious you have stated that all claims dispassionate analysis made posters are unverifiable and fantastical asked you identify one such claim that have made you have failed please now question have made any claims all that are unverifiable and fantastical please repeat them here the context for the question must thank david wood most sensitive and intelligent wrong posting then later likewise the reference unverifiable fantastical claims represents fairly accurately reaction all the claims dispassionate analysis that are repeated this group give your address and pleased send you dictionary failing that can you name one claim that have made that any sense unverifiable fantastical demand that you retract this statement you cannot offer evidence you follow your usual pattern ignoring the challenge then you are simply asshole first you dismissed claims atheists that they became atheists result reason then later you stated that one accepted the axioms reason that one couldn help but become atheist asked you explain the contradiction your only response was statement that the question was incoherent opinion not shared others that have asked they atheist theist you have failed answer the question please now question you retract your claim that posters have not become atheists result reason despite their testimony that effect you don retract that claim you retract the subsequent claim that acceptance the axioms reason inevitably result atheism here the context for the question first quote have here bunch people who claim that their position based reason atheists prove then second quote but not see how one can accept these axioms and not end with atheistic point view first you claimed that you would probably not answer these challenges because they contained too much the way included text from previous posts later you implied that you wouldn respond because was putting words your mouth please clarify this seeming contradiction question you prefer respond challenges that include context from your own posts that paraphrase your positions order avoid included text here the context for the question first you said ordinary rules are that don read articles over over 150 lines articles which there nothing but included text the first screen these are not rules morality but practicality then later someone not going argue with version position then they cannot argued with usual your responses are awaited with anticipation dave wood for the record below compilation charley responses these challenges date this makes sense all gives the appearance either utter incoherence answering some question wood imagination wood not subscribe the opinion that gauntlet thrown down the net requires any response whatsoever some point might read and respond your article and then again might not ordinary rules are that don read articles over over 150 lines articles which there nothing but included text the first screen these are not rules morality but practicality left out something else don respond utmost list things avoid

was really going wife and son were home but daughter was aunt house baku didn say anything wife sat and drank tea sometime around two clock right behind our house suddenly there noise whistling and shouting looked out the window and saw crowd the crowd moving slowly like they show when blacks south africa are striking having demonstration and move slowly wife asks what going out there say don know put some outdoor clothes and went out find out what was all about the crowd people are shouting down with the armenians and death the armenians waited for the entire crowd pass first they went down narimanov street the side with the club and the city party committee then they turned and went against the traffic one way there down the street the baku commissars toward the streetcar line went home and told wife there was demonstration going fact thought that were having the same kind demonstrations that they had had yerevan and karabagh aside from the things they were shouting was surprised that there were only young people the crowd and they were minors under draft age wife and son wanted upstairs visit friend but was kind uneasy and said let stay home instead hour went maybe hour and half well wasn keeping track the time can say exactly how long was look and see another crowd narimanov but now the side with the microdistricts the bazaar and the rossiya movie theater put outside clothes and went out again there noise uproar outside and the crowd has grown there are more people and whereas the first time there were individual shouts this time they are more focused more aggressive think something wrong here this isn any demonstration they would run stop then walk quickly and make sharp dashes and then run again was walking along the sidewalk and they were the street followed them was thinking just watch and see who knew where this was leading came out lenin square the square the club one side and the city party committee the other went toward the square and heard noise and shouting though the whole town had turned out there was some sort rally going closer and hear exclamations appeals heard both anti armenian and anti soviet appeals don need perestroika want living like have been now what did they mean living like have been the azerbaijanis work like everyone else but too many people live the expense the government and the expense others speculation theft and cheating all the time and not just azerbaijan everywhere all the republics but never seen anywhere else like have azerbaijan now this rally someone says that they should around the armenians apartments and drive them out beat them and drive them out true didn hear them say kill them over the microphone only heard beat them and drive them out stayed the square few minutes longer first one then another are going onto the stage and one tries stop the crowd off the side the crowd there were small groups three four people and think they were mvd ministry internal affairs state security kgb there were also uniformed policemen there but didn see any them try pacify the crowd new people kept coming onto the stage well had finally decided that this could end badly this was demonstration and had protect family left the square return home and suddenly noticed truck was next the city party committee narimanov street stood next the tai lor shop there low truck and had low wooden panels see that some thing being unloaded crates some sort decided look because after all those appeals was apprehensive and thought there might weapons there they pulled the crates out onto the square not toward the city party committee but toward the club and when went right them saw that they were cases vodka there were two people handing down the cases from the bed the truck and the ground there were many people they were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried off two people two people one case vodka and there was man standing right next the truck and was handing out roundish black lumps maybe about the size fist maybe little bigger smaller was anasha when passed next that person stood with his side there was about yard and half between and two people were standing near him has package his hand and pulling out anasha and handing out have never smoked myself once tried for fun but seen lot people smoke seen many times and know what strolled around and one asked who was what was doing there before got the glass bazaar heard more howling more warlike shouting turned around and saw them running well just keep going like thought when they caught with saw that they were carrying flags and recognized the person who was carrying the flag side the street young guy years old was carrying red flag which had ermeni oryum written azerbaijani that means death armenians that guy used live off the same courtyard don really know what his name but know his father very well his father name rafik used cook and then became head chef used have dark blue zhiguli van then sold and now has white zhiguli his family said lived the same courtyard did our building was narimanov street and theirs was the street the baku commissars their apartment was the far entryway the fifth floor the door the left now rafik little brother lives there and rafik heard got new apartment either the forth eighth microdistrict word his son was carrying flag that said death armenians was surprised because before this had gotten the impression that all this nonsense was being done not people from sumgait but azerbaijanis from agdam and kafan well anyway went home wife was upset told her pass they young kids they just gotten all whooped naturally didn want her get overly upset after while new surge crowd went and this time they were breaking glass could hear breaking but couldn see where well think here the machine motion they weren handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing didn see people drinking and smoking the spot but they certainly hadn unloaded the vodka and hashish put store window the thought flashed through head that the machine was running one would stop them now they weren even trying although say again the police were there saw them and not just that the police weren breaking them they were joking with them they were having good time true the time couldn even imagine that under our government our much vaunted leadership and not afraid say these words many people died many women were abused and how many abominations there were couldn imagine that under our much vaunted authorities and were specific would say under the much touted authorities our city sumgait couldn imagine that such things could take place when they started breaking glass told wife and son let upstairs went our neighbors the grigorians the fourth floor and the evening when those crowds started going past again went outside once more stopped the corner place called that right next the bazaar look and see crowd the run and there few yards from the entrance the bazaar are three respectable looking men around say years old the crowd was running and one the three waved with his arm and pointed toward the bazaar and then the whole crowd though were one person wheeled and raced toward the bazaar and not soul went past those three though were off limits well everything got all churned there was more noise and the glass was flying again spent the night the neighbors apartment was the first floor there was really way defend yourself there the morning went out buy bread and see what was happening town the way saw someone hunched still never

briefing george stephanopoulos the briefing room edt stephanopoulos good afternoon could this the lawn stephanopoulos that would nice let out the cherry blossoms like the president the stimulus package dead stephanopoulos absolutely not can you tell more about the dole talks you said was good visit but compromise stephanopoulos yes the president had good talk with senator dole last night think that said before there were specific compromises either side although was very good discussion about the jobs package and about other issues well you know the president first called senator dole believe tuesday night talk about the russian aid package they did not speak senator dole called him back wednesday morning when the president was out instead spoke with tony lake and the close that conversation indicated that wanted speak the president about the jobs and stimulus package they finally talked about that yesterday afternoon the close that discussion they said that they would have another talk last night which they did when the senator was new hampshire and although there were specific compromises made either side they did say that they would continue have some discussions and that where are well who giving where standing are both making concessions stephanopoulos don know that that phase compromise has been made the president has said consistently intends come forward with adjusted package believes the package but believes that going take adjustments get the minority release willing make those adjustments the subject vat stephanopoulos boy can stay this for one more minute stephanopoulos sure have problem with the five minutes know decisions have been made but what would lead the health group believe that vat might necessary stephanopoulos sorry andrea not going down that road decisions have been made the president said this morning number groups number members congress number other organizations have recommended that this looked the working group looking but decisions have been made follow have they done that directly through him have labor and business groups been touch with the president about stephanopoulos not knowledge although there lot people who have public decisions support the vat but the president has not made decision the meetings that had with his own task force advisers have they discussed the funding issue and what the possible options would stephanopoulos don think that that has been presented for decision not for decision but has been discussed option stephanopoulos again there are lot levels briefing not believe that the vat has been presented the president okay this something for you decide you not saying didn know was being considered though are you stephanopoulos said being considered knew that but has discussed that with his advisers that what asking stephanopoulos the president has said being considered not know what level discussion there has been over the vat something the working groups are looking don even know that but didn say was considering did this stage stephanopoulos not think getting into something metaphysical debate right here what considered well the one who said haven reviewed stephanopoulos that true that what just repeated george there any concern here that result the definite statement made february and the promise that were considered let know and having trickle out the way did that there may now the development credibility gap this issue and others stephanopoulos don think mean now public knowledge that this being considered you all embarrassed about the absolute statements that were made from this platform the effect that was off the table and was not being considered and then have come out not from you people but stephanopoulos well wait second came out from the administration what are you talking about what saying though that the president said would let know stephanopoulos right you people then said you said believe that not going the program stephanopoulos march 25th march 25th stephanopoulos circumstances change well understand but have find that out rooting around the fine print interview stephanopoulos rooting around know you did very good job there read the usa today article but this laughter the deputy director the omb and the secretary health and human services mean that common anytime you guys write story that has unattributed quote from somebody the clinton administration the headline look right here and story clinton wants more money for spying what about his remark that were being considered tell about stephanopoulos and the administration concerned and let you know and did stephanopoulos yes absolutely what did say this morning had dragged out you here yesterday stephanopoulos didn have dragged out had the deputy director the omb had the secretary health human services say was being considered that his administration that his administration policy were these authorized trial balloons were they orchestrated leaks mean what was the stephanopoulos they were asked questions they answered the questions you saying here that didn have dragged out that you more less made clear yesterday you were considering stephanopoulos absolutely was very clear painfully clear was there particular political strategy making clear the administration considering new tax increase tax day stephanopoulos was just this issue being considered they were asked was being considered they answered that was being considered george the new york times why yesterday stephanopoulos they were asked the new york times reports today that secretary reich and the chief economist the labor department used apples and oranges numbers order portray last month unemployment figures way that was supportive the president job stimulus bill but which turned out totally false stephanopoulos don know was totally false but think laughter the chief economist the labor department did grant that was inappropriate mixing and they say that the question the president concerned about behavior that amounts corrupting government data and what doing about stephanopoulos the chief economist has said that mistake was made won happen again and that the end the matter isn that the same information that goes the president could back the stimulus package stephanopoulos there two separate pieces information think that where the confusion was when did you all first learn about this mistake that was made stephanopoulos read the article this morning and far you know the president aware stephanopoulos think and was aware before read about the new york times stephanopoulos don know not knowledge did you ever hear about before this morning anything stephanopoulos didn wasn the president given erroneous spin this for his own purpose for his speeches for his arguments stephanopoulos well again not sure both statements are true what the labor department has granted that mixing them one sentence essentially was misleading they said was mistake they said they wouldn again did they drop this something that you choose spin make issue stephanopoulos whenever fewer people are out work gratified but that doesn take away from the need get this jobs package going could back the stimulus package for minute you said that the president plans come forward with amendment the timetable still what was that the amendment would laid down monday and voted tuesday did the conversation with dole talk about the possibility putting that off for few more days give more time for the discussion stephanopoulos think this point there changes the schedule all don know that they discussed the timing like that you believe that you closer getting closer this week than you were last week stephanopoulos again believe that going pass jobs package the president prepared make adjustments order get that happen don know where the votes are cloture this particular time don know what going happen until have vote but the president believes deeply this jobs package and wants get done has there been any indication that this situation has changed stephanopoulos going continue work know when the votes are taken george last week you said that there are various people the administration were saying that you couldn through dole you were going have try and around him because was immovable this subject compromise least the compromise wanted was not anything like the one that you could accept this week you talking him that because you realized that the peeling off effort wasn going work stephanopoulos that because senator dole wanted talk the president about the stimulus package initiated the conversation stephanopoulos yes secretary reich this morning said that fact the president not willing compromise this bill all you say making stephanopoulos don know that that exactly what said think said didn have any indication that there was any compromises yet that there would compromise and the president doesn want compromise and the president doesn want compromise but has make adjustments get through will officials here yesterday said that panetta was working series adjustments that might made public before the actual vote stephanopoulos possible today stephanopoulos not sure exactly when that will happen but think that very possible that come forward with some sort different package senate democrats will come forward with some sort different package order get passed understood his conversations with dole the first one was some discussion this and get back you tonight with some details some adjustments whatever the phrase did offer him some details some adjustments stephanopoulos think question how detailed mean think they had general discussion about the package last night subsequent their conversation yesterday afternoon believe that there will follow discussions today the senate not necessarily between the president and senator dole and let just reiterate neither side has made specific compromises this date when have something let you know and not suggesting that senator dole has accepted anything that talked about that offered anything hard way what are the follow discussions not the president and dole stephanopoulos think senator mitchell going talk senator dole that threat laughter did the president say senator dole all right how about this number overall size did dole say the president can high this did they talk numbers stephanopoulos don think was negotiation that respect was more discussion about their positions did they discuss actual numbers stephanopoulos just not sure know they talked about the basic outlines the packages think they talked about the programs they cared about don know they got the level this many billion dollars does dole have sign off before there package stephanopoulos course not did the white house have anything with the protesters who showed new hampshire today where senator dole was speaking was that any way organized stephanopoulos not knowledge and has the president been touch with senators kohl feingold stephanopoulos don think talked them george the president considering the more palatable fact having national sales tax instead having the haves having continuously pay for the have nots and going scrap his proposed tax the privileged few with the haves having pay for the have nots stephanopoulos the president believes deeply that the tax rates upper income americans presented his budget should and think for the second half your question refer you briefing from yesterday george the subject accuracy information you suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money that would solve the water problem milwaukee apparently that not true actually waste water money stephanopoulos waste water money for wisconsin and some could milwaukee but would not affect the drinking water problem because waste water money right stephanopoulos would affect the water treatment overall but the implication from your statement the other day was that would help fix this disease problem milwaukee now would you agree that not the case stephanopoulos not sure the specifics know that goes the overall water treatment wisconsin leftover question from this morning which was when did the president find out that the task force was deliberating vat stephanopoulos not sure exactly when just don know assume came over the last certainly between the time that had commented the past and two days ago sometime since march 25th stephanopoulos think that right don know the exact date george the president this morning mentioned that some labor and business groups are for the vat tax apparently the national association manufacturers talks about perhaps the vat tax being okay replaces the btu tax does the president feel that perhaps this might place some other tax proposed this totally addition the other taxes already proposed stephanopoulos think said all have say about the vat this point mean there just this being considered the health care working groups and that all the president hasn made any further decisions beyond that but would finance health care wouldn replace some other tax that finances wouldn replace the income tax for instance stephanopoulos there have been discussions that terms getting vat tax through congress senator dole press release today said vat tax day you think does have chance getting through congress would have chance stephanopoulos have idea that consideration whether you all put forward stephanopoulos that would become consideration the president were decide not consideration now you said the beginning the briefing that circumstances had changed and that had caused the vat now under consideration stephanopoulos yes what the president referred this morning these groups came forward and said this something that has considered those are the circumstances that have changed that the only difference between now and when emphatically ruled out that groups have asked considered stephanopoulos that what said that true stephanopoulos yes was there fact some understanding that sin taxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits stephanopoulos not going get into the deliberations but george stephanopoulos what the consideration the president said groups came forward and said this something you ought consider the working groups are looking that the only thing that changed since his prior statement and your prior statement the vat stephanopoulos yes can you explain how those groups how that information got him that groups wanted was just reading the newspaper did groups make presentations stephanopoulos think the groups you know the health care task force has met with dozens groups but this the president knowledge that these groups had come forward stephanopoulos think was referring what was coming the working groups obviously there have also been published positions the newspapers have certain groups briefed him the group presentations them stephanopoulos don know they briefed him mean how detailed the briefings have been know that the working groups decided look into this after being pressed these groups what kind arguments did the groups make that were persuasive enough that the president would change the position that had enunciated previously stephanopoulos don know just they had longstanding positions that this would good way finance health care the president wasn aware those longstanding positions stephanopoulos may have been some level obviously been governor for long time and knows the basic arguments for and against vat tax what trying figure out here you telling that the only change the only thing that affected this change the president attitude toward the vat between february and now stephanopoulos the president attitude hasn necessarily changed mean has not made decision know but the president said that was off the table did you and you saying that the only thing that changed the positions these groups except you also describing them longstanding positions don see the change these groups haven had any change their position that been made the president stephanopoulos well they made the presentations the health care task force there relationship all between the fact that sin taxes that had said suggested february that favored will not produce enough revenue finance stephanopoulos don think ever suggested that they would produce all the revenue well suggested that thought that those were appropriate ways finance health care stephanopoulos did say that don know that said anything refute that but fact has the task force discovered that there wouldn enough revenue from those taxes finance the kind core benefits stephanopoulos again don think that the task force ever suggested that there would george advocated vat tax would that break his promise not raise taxes the middle class pay for his programs stephanopoulos can comment hypothetical situation but does that promise would that promise not raise taxes the middle class pay for the programs prevent him from seeking vat tax stephanopoulos the president has made decisions the vat tax when does tell you and explain the implications then which specific groups can you cite business labor otherwise whose recommendations the health care task force has prompted this consideration stephanopoulos don have the specific just don have that george can you tell what extend these other alternatives for instance the employer tax the sin taxes other financing options are also still the table and what these options are stephanopoulos members the task force and representatives the working groups have said they are looking wide variety options think that ira magaziner said that there are different options under consideration but not going comment what the scope stephanopoulos just not going comment them what the scope the need how much are you talking about that has produced one combination the stephanopoulos that what the health care task force looking since there not going any briefing the miyazawa visit two questions one generally what does the president hope use that meeting for but more specifically his task complicated the japanese anger over the vancouver note and the remark about market access the press conference stephanopoulos the vancouver note does mean yes yes and stephanopoulos well don know saw the prime minister press conference where was asked the question about that note and gave very gracious and complete answer when was asked the question the questions trade are something that certainly will discussed between the prime minister and the president there obviously trade imbalance between japan and the that want something about also those comments the prime minister made suggested that the united states should come down heavy him terms trade are you going oblige stephanopoulos think the president will state our views trade very clearly and our views the trade deficit very clearly don necessarily want agree with your characterization the prime minister comments that need specific export targets specific numerical targets that what going discuss with miyazawa stephanopoulos they going have broad discussion wide range trade issues don want get into those specifics until after the meeting why that the crux the issue right whether not does the president believe that without specific numerical targets really said his press conference sort hopeless that this going change very much stephanopoulos the president believes that must have pressure japan turn the trade imbalance around not want get into the specifics how that would done but does the president believe that their stimulus package announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance stephanopoulos think first the president wants get full briefing the stimulus package from prime minister miyazawa himself and then make the comment how about the russian aid package there seems some confusion about how the views that secretary christopher saying bentsen saying the japanese may need more the japanese saying that that not what they heard stephanopoulos again going continue work with all our allies the and going continue press for help for russian reform russian democratic reform and think that far had very good announcement out tokyo and going continue work with our allies for bilateral packages you think the japanese need more stephanopoulos going continue work with all our allies much can secretary christopher was asked today the today show this morning what thought margaret thatcher comments the bosnia policy and said rather emotional response stephanopoulos over emotional issue right emotional problem does the white house condone that kind remark stephanopoulos think that secretary christopher remarks speaks for itself the president believes also that this deeply troubling situation that trying find answers for but that specific rather emotional response specific term stephanopoulos speaks for itself connection with that doesn seem that with the numbers people who are being killed this very moment good american policy put off some decisions that might made now help boris yeltsin win referendum stephanopoulos for example take stronger action take military action air strikes anything that can done stephanopoulos the president believes that what must done now push harder for sanctions also you know the administration has been discussing lifting the arms embargo believes those are the appropriate ways increase pressure this time what your response the critics who would say that the now stymied trying help boris yeltsin retain the presidency stephanopoulos they wrong pressing hard for the serbs come the negotiating table pressing hard for increased sanctions and talking our allies about the arms embargo you were putting great store vance and owen getting people agree that now vance and owen have both said that military force some extent would acceptable does that change your thinking stephanopoulos clearly going listen whatever people who have put much time into situation have say but this point the president moving forward sanctions and talking about the arms embargo follow dee dee comment this morning she said she would able provide some administration officials who could document the effect the sanctions are having bosnia are you going able that you have anything stephanopoulos don think that what she said that exactly what she said stephanopoulos don think that true but what she said would look into the situation what kind evidence can provided bosnia obviously there are connections between the bosnian serbs and the serbs belgrade and are tightening the screws the serbs belgrade that will have effect over time not know day day minute minute what kind help being given between the two and what the exact effect has been but clearly are slowing the shipment goods into belgrade are having effect the serbs there what kind effect that will eventually have the bosnian serbs don know but one thing would say were having effect all don know why they fighting much are the first lady tax returns going released stephanopoulos think there joint tax return and will probably later today the president considering signing executive order banning discrimination against homosexuals the federal work force part the gay rights march here next week stephanopoulos don think there any proposal for that this time not that know something that the president promised during the campaign that would stephanopoulos have not seen any don think anything that his plate right now meeting with gay rights leaders any point this issue stephanopoulos don know about this issue assume that meet with representatives the gay and lesbian community sometime soon meets with representatives lots different groups and communities you know that scheduled stephanopoulos probably going tomorrow probably going tomorrow laughter good thing you asked who probably going there laughter stephanopoulos don know how long stephanopoulos don know that all know you know tomorrow laughter stephanopoulos don know what time don even know for sure going tomorrow environmental groups have asked him make major speech next week some kind that going happen you know stephanopoulos don know they asked but think the president has always planned did last year give speech earth day and expect that will not exactly earth day might day before something like that planning sign announce the signing the biodiversity treaty connection with earth day stephanopoulos again don know the specific timing something like that but certainly something under discussion and something been working campaign finance reform stephanopoulos working you think will next week stephanopoulos just not sure the biodiversity treaty something you working missed the question stephanopoulos yes something working asked was ready signed and said didn know anything about that but something certainly been working you know what organizations might represented this meeting with the gay and lesbian groups stephanopoulos don you know going reconsider being out town the day the march stephanopoulos got the senate meeting jamestown and believe also going giving speech the american association newspaper publishers boston sunday did last year would you have told she had not pressed you the question stephanopoulos what the gays stephanopoulos when went through the president schedule for the day certainly george what day the publisher speech that sunday stephanopoulos think sunday and saturday jamestown stephanopoulos yes you just going jamestown for one day stephanopoulos not sure don know how long the senate thing goes might overnight just don know you would have made the gay meeting public right stephanopoulos certain had the meeting don know about open the press but would have told you about mean because far can tell the first time history president has met the oval office with stephanopoulos didn say was going the oval office laughter but didn not say that not but didn say that was laughter the white house the bush administration gay officials were invited bill signing ceremony and the white house had repudiate having done that just wanted make sure stephanopoulos well the president wouldn anything like that certainly not what marching orders did the president give general vessey stephanopoulos they had very good discussion for about half hour today wanted the most important thing was had full accounting for american pows and mias will obviously look into the circumstances surrounding this new document the president stressed that wanted the fullest possible accounting and said that only when have that can even consider any changes our policy towards vietnam looking vietnam response the questions raised the document and also look into investigations discrepancy cases increased efforts remains implementing trilateral investigations and access military archives and ambassador toon also briefed the president the activities the joint commission and the document vietnam says fake what the dod analysis this stage stephanopoulos not completed yet and also the first thing that general vessey will bring with the vietnamese number defense officials have been saying that they think that the 600 prisoners referred are fact non americans that the vietnamese had captured who they referred americans from time time people stephanopoulos don have any final determination going wait for the complete review when have make judgment know you don have any final determination but given all the intense public interest this you think that that likely possibility stephanopoulos just don want characterize any way until the review complete george was there topic scheduled for the speech boston stephanopoulos the president going have press conference tomorrow with miyazawa stephanopoulos think but not positive yes expect yes was toon with vessey stephanopoulos yes was the meeting stephanopoulos yes what was the question stephanopoulos was ambassador toon with vessey and the answer yes you have any response the wall street journal report this morning the president distressed about some his press clippings and that perhaps distressed with you about that stephanopoulos well have response think the article was highly misleading the extent that implied that the president has had restricted access the press would point out that answered 358 questions occasions more than any his predecessors would also point out also how many questions stephanopoulos three hundred fifty eight occasions how many were while was jogging stephanopoulos well that actually very good question andrea and would point out further that the article also implied that these questions were only answered tightly controlled photo opportunities which just patently false had press conferences either the east room the oval office the roosevelt room the briefing room addition questions taken photo opportunities and that only the oval office press conference when was that stephanopoulos answered questions the east room had five the east room had one the oval office had one the rose garden had one two the roosevelt room and this just the white house washington press corps addition that had interviews with local television anchors met with the editorial board the portland oregonian had hour long interview with dan rather had interviews with local press from california florida and connecticut can you address the question the attitude the article implies that doesn why doesn like laughter did you really get blamed for that post story the story that you are you held responsible for stephanopoulos don think going comment about this are you denying that the president has shown displeasure publicly stephanopoulos not commenting the discussions between the president and myself did the president write that letter chris webber stephanopoulos what the letter the university michigan basketball player stephanopoulos yes that authentic letter stephanopoulos yes since the president first talked about the vat february said the time that thought there probably should exceptions made basic necessities such food and clothing does still hold that position given the impact could have stephanopoulos again just can comment proposal hasn made george does the president have some agenda for this meeting with the gay leaders tomorrow stephanopoulos well think will just general meeting the wide range issues that they care about including aids and other issues civil rights the military issue stephanopoulos certain will come using this event name the aids stephanopoulos don think george what specifically the president doing prepare for tomorrow meeting with the prime minister miyazawa stephanopoulos had briefing memos had general discussions with members the treasury department the trade representative and others report yet stephanopoulos don know has the report referred the times but ambassador kantor was here brief him today was stephanopoulos yes does intend use any these instances that stephanopoulos again don know that the report been presented but obviously the president will press hard any case where thinks that violation has occurred terms the wall street journal the thrust was that there real schism here hostility you think feels that way stephanopoulos not all said the record the article think the president likes reporters again think that the thrust the article was still misleading the thrust the article was that some way some attitude which the president may may not have affecting access when fact has the most open accessible administration than have any recent history can come your office laughter stephanopoulos you invited the press thank you end edt

 |text from mcelwre cnsvax uwec edu subject the divine masters organization university wisconsin eau claire lines 208 the divine masters most christians would agree and correctly that jesus christ was divine master and projection god into the physical world god incarnate but there are some very important related facts that christians are completely ignorant are followers most other world religions first jesus christ was not unique john notwith standing there always least one such divine master god incarnate physically alive this world all times continuous succession throughout history both before and after the life jesus the followers some these masters founded the world major religions usually perverting the teachings their master the process christians for example added threats eternal damnation hell and deleted the teaching reincarnation secondly and more importantly after particular master physically dies and leaves this world there nothing that can for anybody except for the relatively few people that initiated while was still physically alive that simply the way god set things the universes therefore all those christians who worship jesus and pray jesus and expect jesus return and save them from their sins are only kidding themselves and have allowed themselves duped religion that was mostly manufactured the romans and emotional feelings are totally deceiving indicator for religious validity these things are similarly true for followers most other major world religions including islam thirdly the primary function each master tune his initiates into the audible life stream sound current referred the word john and the river life revelation and personally guide each them thru the upper levels heaven while they are still connected their living physical bodies silver cord true salvation which completes soul cycles reincarnation the physical and psychic planes achieved only reaching least the soul plane which five levels universes above the physical universe and this cannot done without the help physically living divine master one such divine master alive today american sri harold klemp the living eck master mahanta for the eckankar organization now headquartered minneapolis box 27300 zip 55427 another divine master maharaj gurinder singh now living punjab india and associated with the sant mat organization one the classic books this subject the path the masters radha soami books box 242 gardena 90247 written 1939 julian johnson theologian and surgeon who spent the last years his life india studying under and closely observing the sant mat master that time maharaj sawan singh several the eckankar books including some authored sri paul twitchell sri harold klemp can found most public and university libraries and some book stores obtained thru inter library loan the book eckankar the key secret worlds sri paul twitchell another classic many christians are likely confuse the masters with the anti christ which was temporary world dictator during the called last days but the masters don ever rule even when asked expected jesus was people who continue following christianity islam other orthodox religions with physically dead master will continue their cycles reincarnation between the psychic planes and this miserable physical world until they finally accept initiation from physically living divine master incarnation the book here and hereafter ruth montgomery describes several kinds evidence supporting reincarnation fact life including hypnotic regressions past lives about accurate the subconscious mind sometimes makes things especially with bad hypnotist spontaneous recall especially young children some whom can identify their most recent previous relatives homes possessions etc dream recall past life experi ences deja familiarity with far off land while travel ing there for the first time vacation the psychic read ings the late edgar cayce and even supporting statements from the christian bible including matthew john the baptist was the reincarnation elias and john how can person possibly sin before born unless lived before always use the king james version later versions are per versions strong interests innate talents strong phobias etc typically originate from person past lives for example strong fear swimming traveling over water usually results from having drowned the end previous life and sometimes person will take immediate dislike another person being met for the first time this life because bad encounter with him during previous incarnation the teaching reincarnation also includes the law karma galatians revelation etc people would behave much better toward each other they knew that their actions the present will surely reaped them the future future incarnation 2nd comings divine master physically dies translates before particular initiate his does then when that initiate physically dies translates the master will meet him the astral level and take him directly the soul plane this the one and only correct meaning 2nd coming individual experience not something that happens for everyone all once people who are still waiting for jesus 2nd coming are waiting vain planes existence the physical universe the lowest least dozen major levels existence above the physical plane the astral plane the causal plane the mental plane the etheric plane often counted the upper part the mental plane the soul plane and several higher spiritual planes the soul plane the first true heaven counting upward from the physical the planes between but not including the physical and soul planes are called the psychic planes likely that esp telepathy astrological influences radionic effects biological transmutations see the 1972 book with that title and other phenomena without apparent physical origin result from interactions between the psychic planes and the physical plane the major planes are also sub divided for example sub plane the astral plane called hades and the christian hell occupies small part created there less than 2000 years ago the early catholic church some kind black magic simply teaching its existence threatening manner the christian heaven located elsewhere the astral plane good christians will there for short while and then reincarnate back earth sound current blind faith the christian religion demands its followers extraordinary amount blind faith backed little more than good feeling which totally deceiving person not hearing some form the sound current the word the bani the audible life stream then his cycles reincarnation this miserable world will continue the sound current manifests differently for different initiates and can sound like rushing wind ocean waves the sea shore buzzing bees higher pitched buzzing sound flute various heavenly music other sounds eckankar members start hearing near the end their first year member this and other experiences such soul travel replace blind faith for more information answers your questions etc please consult cited sources books addresses altered reproduction and dissemination this important information encouraged robert mcelwaine 2nd initiate eckankar

distribution world organization mantis consultants cambridge supersedes 19930322114724 mantis lines 632 archive name atheism logic alt atheism archive name logic last modified april 1993 version constructing logical argument although there much argument usenet the general quality argument found poor this article attempts provide gentle introduction logic the hope improving the general level debate logic the science reasoning proof thinking inference concise oed logic allows analyze piece reasoning and determine whether correct not valid invalid course one does not need study logic order reason correctly nevertheless little basic knowledge logic often helpful when constructing analyzing argument note that claim being made here about whether logic universally applicable the matter very much open for debate this document merely explains how use logic given that you have already decided that logic the right tool for the job propositions statements are the building blocks logical argument proposition statement which either true false for example raining today tuesday propositions may either asserted said true denied said false note that this technical meaning deny not the everyday meaning the proposition the meaning the statement not the particular arrangement words used express god exists and there exists god both express the same proposition argument quote the monty python sketch connected series statements establish definite proposition argument consists three stages first all the propositions which are necessary for the argument continue are stated these are called the premises the argument they are the evidence reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions premises assertions are often indicated phrases such because since obviously and the phrase obviously often viewed with suspicion can used intimidate others into accepting suspicious premises something doesn seem obvious you don afraid question you can always say yes you right obvious when you heard the explanation next the premises are used derive further propositions process known inference inference one proposition arrived the basis one more other propositions already accepted there are various forms valid inference the propositions arrived inference may then used further inference inference often denoted phrases such implies that therefore finally arrive the conclusion the argument the proposition which affirmed the basis the premises and inference conclusions are often indicated phrases such therefore follows that conclude and the conclusion often stated the final stage inference for example every event has cause premise the universe has beginning premise all beginnings involve event premise this implies that the beginning the universe involved event inference therefore the universe has cause inference and conclusion note that the conclusion one argument might premise another argument proposition can only called premise conclusion with respect particular argument the terms not make sense isolation sometimes argument will not follow the order given above for example the conclusions might stated first and the premises stated afterwards support the conclusion this perfectly valid sometimes little confusing recognizing argument much harder than recognizing premises conclusions many people shower their writing with assertions without ever producing anything which one might reasonably describe argument some statements look like arguments but are not for example the bible accurate jesus must either have been insane evil liar the son god this not argument conditional statement does not assert the premises which are necessary support what appears its conclusion also suffers from number other logical flaws but come those later another example god created you therefore your duty god the phrase your duty god not proposition since neither true nor false therefore not conclusion and the sentence not argument finally causality important consider statement the form because interested establishing and offered evidence the statement argument trying establish the truth then not argument explanation for example there must something wrong with the engine car because will not start this argument car will not start because there something wrong with the engine this explanation there are two traditional types argument deductive and inductive deductive argument one which provides conclusive proof its conclusions that argument where the premises are true the conclusion must also true deductive argument either valid invalid valid argument defined one where the premises are true then the conclusion true inductive argument one where the premises provide some evidence for the truth the conclusion inductive arguments are not valid invalid however can talk about whether they are better worse than other arguments and about how probable their premises are there are forms argument ordinary language which are neither deductive nor inductive however will concentrate for the moment deductive arguments they are often viewed the most rigorous and convincing important note that the fact that deductive argument valid does not imply that its conclusion holds this because the slightly counter intuitive nature implication which must now consider more carefully obviously valid argument can consist true propositions however argument may entirely valid even contains only false propositions for example all insects have wings premise woodlice are insects premise therefore woodlice have wings conclusion here the conclusion not true because the argument premises are false the argument premises were true however the conclusion would true the argument thus entirely valid more subtly can reach true conclusion from one more false premises all fish live the sea premise dolphins are fish premise therefore dolphins live the sea conclusion however the one thing cannot reach false conclusion through valid inference from true premises can therefore draw truth table for implication the symbol denotes implication the premise the conclusion and represent true and false respectively premise conclusion inference the premises are false and the inference valid the conclusion can true false the premises are true and the conclusion false the inference must invalid the premises are true and the inference valid the conclusion must true sound argument valid argument whose premises are true sound argument therefore arrives true conclusion careful not confuse valid arguments with sound arguments delve further into the structure logical arguments would require lengthy discussion linguistics and philosophy simpler and probably more useful summarize the major pitfalls avoided when constructing argument these pitfalls are known fallacies everyday english the term fallacy used refer mistaken beliefs well the faulty reasoning that leads those beliefs this fair enough but logic the term generally used refer form technically incorrect argument especially the argument appears valid convincing for the purposes this discussion define fallacy logical argument which appears correct but which can seen incorrect when examined more closely studying fallacies aim avoid being misled them the following list fallacies not intended exhaustive argumentum baculum appeal force the appeal force committed when the arguer resorts force the threat force order try and push the acceptance conclusion often used politicians and can summarized might makes right the force threatened need not direct threat from the arguer for example thus there ample proof the truth the bible all those who refuse accept that truth will burn hell argumentum hominem argumentum hominem literally argument directed the man the abusive variety argumentum hominem occurs when instead trying disprove the truth assertion the arguer attacks the person people making the assertion this invalid because the truth assertion does not depend upon the goodness those asserting for example atheism evil philosophy practised communists and murderers sometimes court law doubt cast upon the testimony witness showing for example that known perjurer this valid way reducing the credibility the testimony given the witness and not argumentum hominem however does not demonstrate that the witness testimony false conclude otherwise fall victim the argumentum ignorantiam see elsewhere this list the circumstantial form argumentum hominem committed when person argues that his opponent ought accept the truth assertion because the opponent particular circumstances for example perfectly acceptable kill animals for food how can you argue otherwise when you quite happy wear leather shoes this abusive charge inconsistency used excuse for dismissing the opponent argument this fallacy can also used means rejecting conclusion for example course you would argue that positive discrimination bad thing you white this particular form argumentum hominem when one alleges that one adversary rationalizing conclusion formed from selfish interests also known poisoning the well argumentum ignorantium argumentum ignorantium means argument from ignorance this fallacy occurs whenever argued that something must true simply because has not been proved false equivalently when argued that something must false because has not been proved true note that this not the same assuming that something false until has been proved true basic scientific principle examples course the bible true nobody can prove otherwise course telepathy and other psychic phenomena not exist nobody has shown any proof that they are real note that this fallacy does not apply court law where one generally assumed innocent until proven guilty also scientific investigation known that event would produce certain evidence its having occurred the absence such evidence can validly used infer that the event did not occur for example flood described the bible would require enormous volume water present the earth the earth does not have tenth much water even count that which frozen into ice the poles therefore such flood occurred science can validly assume from lack evidence that something has not occurred cannot conclude with certainty that has not occurred however argumentum misericordiam this the appeal pity also known special pleading the fallacy committed when the arguer appeals pity for the sake getting conclusion accepted for example did not murder mother and father with axe please don find guilty suffering enough through being orphan argumentum populum this known appealing the gallery appealing the people commit this fallacy attempt win acceptance assertion appealing large group people this form fallacy often characterized emotive language for example pornography must banned violence against women the bible must true millions people know that are you trying tell them that they are all mistaken fools argumentum numeram this fallacy closely related the argumentum populum consists asserting that the more people who support believe proposition the more likely that that proposition correct argumentum verecundiam the appeal authority uses the admiration the famous try and win support for assertion for example isaac newton was genius and believed god this line argument not always completely bogus for example reference admitted authority particular field may relevant discussion that subject for example can distinguish quite clearly between stephen hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation and john searle has concluded that impossible build intelligent computer hawking physicist and can reasonably expect his opinions black hole radiation informed searle linguist questionable whether well qualified speak the subject machine intelligence the fallacy accident the fallacy accident committed when general rule applied particular case whose accidental circumstances mean that the rule inapplicable the error made when one goes from the general the specific for example christians generally dislike atheists you are christian you must dislike atheists this fallacy often committed moralists and legalists who try decide every moral and legal question mechanically applying general rules converse accident hasty generalization this fallacy the reverse the fallacy accident occurs when one forms general rule examining only few specific cases which are not representative all possible cases for example jim bakker was insincere christian therefore all christians are insincere sweeping generalization dicto simpliciter sweeping generalization occurs when general rule applied particular situation which the features that particular situation render the rule inapplicable sweeping generalization the opposite hasty generalization non causa pro causa post hoc ergo propter hoc these are known false cause fallacies the fallacy non causa pro causa occurs when one identifies something the cause event but has not actually been shown the cause for example took aspirin and prayed god and headache disappeared god cured the headache the fallacy post hoc ergo propter hoc occurs when something assumed the cause event merely because happened before the event for example the soviet union collapsed after taking atheism therefore must avoid atheism for the same reasons cum hoc ergo propter hoc this fallacy similar post hoc ergo propter hoc asserts that because two events occur together they must causally related and leaves room for other factors that may the cause the events petitio principii this fallacy occurs when the premises are least questionable the conclusion reached circulus demonstrando this fallacy occurs when one assumes premise the conclusion which one wishes reach often the proposition will rephrased that the fallacy appears valid argument for example homosexuals must not allowed hold government office hence any government official who revealed homosexual will lose his job therefore homosexuals will anything hide their secret and will open blackmail therefore homosexuals cannot allowed hold government office note that the argument entirely circular the premise the same the conclusion argument like the above has actually been cited the reason for the british secret services official ban homosexual employees another example the classic know that god exists because the bible tells and know that the bible true because the word god complex question fallacy interrogation this the fallacy presupposition one example the classic loaded question have you stopped beating your wife the question presupposes definite answer another question which has not even been asked this trick often used lawyers cross examination when they ask questions like where did you hide the money you stole similarly politicians often ask loaded questions such how long will this interference our affairs allowed continue does the chancellor plan two more years ruinous privatization ignoratio elenchi the fallacy irrelevant conclusion consists claiming that argument supports particular conclusion when actually logically nothing with that conclusion for example christian may begin saying that will argue that the teachings christianity are undoubtably true then argues length that christianity great help many people matter how well argues will not have shown that christian teachings are true sadly such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse emotions which cause others view the supposed conclusion more favourable light equivocation equivocation occurs when key word used with two more different meanings the same argument for example what could more affordable than free software but make sure that remains free that users can what they like with must place license make sure that will always freely redistributable amphiboly amphiboly occurs when the premises used argument are ambiguous because careless ungrammatical phrasing accent accent another form fallacy through shifting meaning this case the meaning changed altering which parts statement are emphasized for example consider should not speak ill our friends and should not speak ill our friends fallacies composition one fallacy composition conclude that property shared the parts something must apply the whole for example the bicycle made entirely low mass components and therefore very lightweight the other fallacy composition conclude that property number individual items shared collection those items for example car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than bus therefore cars are less environmentally damaging than buses fallacy division the fallacy division the opposite the fallacy composition like its opposite exists two varieties the first assume that property some thing must apply its parts for example you are studying rich college therefore you must rich the other assume that property collection items shared each item for example ants can destroy tree therefore this ant can destroy tree the slippery slope argument this argument states that should one event occur will other harmful events there proof made that the harmful events are caused the first event for example legalize marijuana then would have legalize crack and heroin and have nation full drug addicts welfare therefore cannot legalize marijuana based fallacies type fallacies these fallacies occur when one attempts argue that things are some way similar without actually specifying what way they are similar examples isn history based upon faith then isn the bible also form history islam based faith christianity based faith isn islam form christianity cats are form animal based carbon chemistry dogs are form animal based carbon chemistry aren dogs form cat affirmation the consequent this fallacy argument the form implies true therefore true understand why fallacy examine the truth table for implication given earlier denial the antecedent this fallacy argument the form implies false therefore false again the truth table for implication makes clear why this fallacy note that this fallacy different from non causa pro causa the latter has the form implies false therefore false where does not fact imply all here the problem not that the implication invalid rather that the falseness does not allow deduce anything about converting conditional this fallacy argument the form then therefore then argumentum antiquitam this the fallacy asserting that something right good simply because old because that the way always been argumentum novitam this the opposite the argumentum antiquitam the fallacy asserting that something more correct simply because new newer than something else argumentum crumenam the fallacy believing that money criterion correctness that those with more money are more likely right argumentum lazarum the fallacy assuming that because someone poor she sounder more virtuous than one who wealthier this fallacy the opposite the argumentum crumenam argumentum nauseam this the incorrect belief that assertion more likely true the more often heard argumentum nauseum one that employs constant

than signal itself this not problem specific xlib and the posix specification mentions other functions which may called safely but may not assumed that these functions are called xlib functions you

very common need write program that can accept input both from user via the connection and from some other file descriptor but which operates efficiently and without blocking either the connection the other file descriptor solution use xtappaddinput after you open your file descriptor use xtappaddinput register input handler the input handler will called every time there something the file descriptor requiring your program attention write the input handler like you would any other callback does its work quickly and returns important use only non blocking system calls your input handlers most input handlers read the file descriptor although you can have input handler write handle exception conditions you wish careful when you register input handler read from disk file you will find that the function called even when there isn input pending xtappaddinput actually working supposed the input handler called whenever the file descriptor ready read not only when there new data read disk file unlike pipe socket almost always ready read however only because you can spin back the beginning and read data you read before the result that your function will almost always called every time around xtappmainloop there way get the type interaction you are expecting add this line the beginning your function test whether there new data ioctl fionread return but because this called frequently your application effectively busy wait you may better off not using xtappaddinput and instead setting timer and the timer procedure checking the file for input courtesy dan heller argv ora

which single display supports server can support several independent screens they are numbered unix unix unix etc the screen screen_number the second digit the which can thought index into the array available screens this particular display connection the macros which you can use obtain information about the particular screen which your application running typically have two forms one which takes screen and one with takes both the display and the screen_number based programs you typically use xtscreen widget determine the screen which your application running uses single screen part the confusion may arise from the fact that some the macros which return characteristics the screen have display the names xdisplaywidth xdisplayheight etc subject 136 can use with x11 motif xview the

background black for example should produce white however the drawing operation does not work rgb values but colormap indices the color that the resulting colormap index actually points undefined and visually random unless you have actually filled yourself many servers black and white often programs taking advantage this mathematical coincidence will break you want combining colors with gxxor then you should allocating number your own color cells and filling them with your chosen pre computed values you want use gxxor simply switch between two colors then you can take the shortcut setting the background color the graphics context and the foreground color value such that when draws over red say the result blue and when draws over blue the result red this foreground value itself the xor the

gratuitously insult someone electronically when you would not anything like that face face these insults are known flames issuing them called flaming flames often start when member disagrees with something another member has posted over the network typical sophisticated intelligent form calm reasoned rebuttal would something like what incredibly stupid statement you spandex clad poseur this

0011 periodically the question what dod raised this one those questions the same class why the sky blue there god why there much suffering the world and why women inevitably tell you that you such

giving whit about what other people thought and generally being right thinking individual did flaming and other amusements followed who would become the holder dod membership thought this was the funniest thing seen while being the sort that pretty easily amused claimed membership the denizens doom motorcycle club and started signing his postings with his membership number perhaps readers rec motorcycles were struck with the vision motorcycle club with dues rules restrictions brand make model national origin motorcycle club organized electronically may well that readers were yearning become part something that would provide them with greater identity gestalt personality something which the whole was greater than the sum its parts could also that all computer nerds who wear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors who just happen also love taking risks machines with awesome power weight ratios social outcasts who saw clique that would finally open minded enough accept members clear case self fulfilling prophesy the denizens doom motorcycle club was born club which the majority members have never met one another face face and perhaps like that way yet feel that they know one another pretty well well enough given some the electronic personalities the newsgroup club organized and run the loosest sense the word volunteers through the network via electronic news and mail with membership mailing list often used organize group rides amongst members who live the same region motto logo series photo albums circulating around the country organized dod club patches organized and even mtv style music video produced and distributed vhs where will end who knows will the dod start sanctioning races placing limits the memory and clock rate the board engine management

l0c acsu buffalo edu psyrobtw ubvmsb buffalo edu robert weiss says just briefly something that you mentioned passing you refer differing interpretations create and say that many christians may not agree what that really irrelevant not base our faith how many people think one way another the bottom line truth regardless popularity opinions may irrelevant you and your personal beliefs should say bias but relevant and many others you right the bottom line truth independant from you anyone else since you proclaim truths self proclaimed appointee may ask you what authority you this because says the bible does the bible say you someone else who interprets whether scripture doctrine conforms your particular liking disapproval excuse moi but your line truths haven moved one bit persuade that beliefs are erroneous all the preachers truth this net you have struck self righteous member the wrecking crew with positive message any other latter day saint btw this entire discussion reminds lot the things said jesus the pharisees hypocrite preach about with your lips but your hearts are far removed from also find rather strange that trying persuade that created and eternally existent are equivalent you say granted the mormon belief you can grant your conclusion and then expect the point have been addressed order reply the issue you have address and answer the point that was raised and not just jump the conclusion that you grant sophistry look who talking jumping conclusions you wouldn that yourself right all you address your own convictions regardless whether come with any biblical scriptures which supports our points view because you reject such interpretations without any consideration whatsoever the bible states that lucifer was created the bible states that jesus the creator all the contradiction that have that the lds belief that jesus and lucifer were the same beautiful example disinformation and deliberate misrepresentation lds doctrine the former kgb would have loved employ you jesus and lucifer are not the same silly and you know the mormon belief that all are children god literally there nothing symbolic about this however contradicts what the bible says the bible teaches that not everyone child god correction may contradict would you think the bible says the bible indeed does teach that not all are children god the sense that they belong follow god his footsteps satan and his followers have rebelled against god and are not children followers redeemed god but doesn mean that they were not once created god but chose separate themselves from those who chose follow god and his plan salvation the field the world the good seed are the children the kingdom but the tares are the children the wicked one matthew this illustrates nicely what just said the children the kingdom are those who have remained valiant their testimony jesus and have shown works repentance etc and the children the wicked one are those who rebelled against god and the lamb the issue satan spirit origin and those who followed him has not been addressed this and other verses you copied from your bible you purposefully obscured the subject swamping your right with non related scriptures lots nice scriptures deleted not robert copyrighted though are told that and this life eternal that they might know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent john life eternal know the only true god yet the doctrines the lds that have mentioned portray vastly different jesus jesus that cannot reconciled with the jesus the bible they are far removed from each other that proclaim correction jesus indeed different than your jesus and can reconciled with the jesus the bible not your interpretation him concur but honestly couldn care less one being true denies the other from being true according the bible eternal life dependent knowing the only true god and not the construct imagination this single posting yours seen more constructs imagination than all the pro lds mails combined have read far this news group first get your lds facts straight before you dare preaching about the only true god whom you interpret according your own likes and dislikes but whose image cannot reconcile with what know about him myself guess your grandiose self image does not allow for other faiths believing the divinity jesus christ but different way fashion than your own not that really matters the mission and progress the lds church will boldly and nobly and mob opponent can stop the work from progressing until has visited every continent swept every clime and sounded every ear this really red herring doesn address any issue raised but rather seeks obfuscate the fact that some groups try read something into the bible doesn change what the bible teaches sigh what the bible teaches what the bible teaches according robert weiss and respect the former reject the latter without the remotest feeling that have rejected jesus the contrary and the way respect your interpretations the bible even grant you being christian following your own image him much christian following own image him heart most the other replies have instead hop scotched the issue bruce mcconkie and whether his views were official doctrine don think that matters mcconkie views were canon that not the issue were mcconkie writings indicative mormon belief this subject the real issue the indication from rick that they may certainly the issue course that you love use anything either mis represent ridicule the lds church the issue official doctrine obviously very important mcconkie views have been controversial the seven deadly heresies has made heretic best erroneous worst blacks not receive the priesthood this dispensation respect him someone who has made his valuable contribution the church but personally not rely his personal interpretations his book mormon doctrine oftentimes referred mcconkie bible mormon circles mormon doctrine rather look official doctrinal sources and hugh nibley books the last comment lds insider reference summarizing mcconkie was wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more the kingdom god than have but whose views are means dogma accepted doctrine some clearly belongs personal interpretation and speculation but having said this find mcconkie even his most biased and speculative moments far more thought provoking than the trash

item concessional food sales you know the united states has had long term grain relationship with russia important and important russia that continue that relationship the president has chosen the food for progress program which concessional loan program the value over the next seven months 700 million these are concessional terms the exact terms have not been worked out but think fair say there will grace period principal six seven years and concessional rates thereafter for the life the deal the third program collection private sector support think this one the most important things going privatization and the creation small businesses the number one priority the reform government moscow and the president has decided create russian american enterprise fund capitalized this year million and the goal this fund make direct loans small businesses russia take equity positions those businesses the president has also decided create privatization fund which would work directly with the russian government its priority objective trying convert state enterprises from state owned basis private basis has also agreed the president has also agreed establish eurasia foundation this would private foundation led prominent americans fund democratization projects russia the fourth grouping you see there the summary page democratization itself think fair say that this administration has given new impetus the goal pursuing democratization russia you see that have total million programs various programs the detailed tables give indication some the programs that launching the president also calling for the development democracy corps which will overarching umbrella group try incorporate all the disparate private and public efforts now underway from the united states support reform russia the fifth program you see russian office resettlement this new initiative created and conceptualized this administration this demonstration project what like work with the russian military help resettle russian officers returning from the baltic states and other parts the former soviet union want make sure that work out the best way that whether with russian labor and russian materials using prefab american construction and decided fund demonstration basis the construction 450 housing units working very closely with the russian military this and would say that have long term commitment this project the sixth area energy the environment they are two issues that the president feels strongly about our initial efforts will feasibility studies look into the possibility enhancing their energy production both oil and gas and equally important trying cut down the leakages the oil and gas pipeline systems which cause much environmental damage talked little bit about trade and investment about the new group being created that the vice president will chair our side secretary ron brown will also cochairing with deputy prime minister shohkin business development committee which will work all other sectors the economy break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede trade and investment are also going appoint full time investment ombudsman the american government work this problem full time and the point like make here trade and investment the 1990s every bit important draw analogy arms reductions was the 70s and 80s and just thought that looking this needed make commitment within our own government have people work senior people full time basis because terribly important you notice that the united states going support russia membership the gatt russia has had observer status russia has requested our support and fact requested our advice becoming member the gatt think that the long term goal drawing russia into the global economy paramount very important goal and that why are supporting the membership the gatt are also supporting their access gsp the generalized system preferences you note that has extended million credit for caterpillar deal siberia that opic has extended 150 million credits and loan guarantees for conoco oil project like emphasize that are very close agreement between russia and the united states for billion framework facility through the bank that would finance russian purchases american oil and gas equipment and services think this very important development think get there april 14th which the opening day the tokyo conference the conference before take any further questions like defer colleague who will review the security assistance objectives with you senior administration official our major unfinished agenda with the russians and with their counterparts ukraine kazakhstan and belarus the area the safe and secure dismantlement the nuclear arsenals their territory under the terms the start and start agreements recently completed moscow three think very important agreements that devote significant chunk nunn lugar funding three important programs the first the program 130 million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement program that for submarines for icbm dismantlement and for bomber dismantlement 130 million the second million tranche funding for the construction facility store nuclear materials removed from the warheads they are dismantled this will essentially contribute the overall design and the early phases the construction that storage facility and finally million tranche money help the establishment monitoring system for the nuclear materials they are withdrawn from the weapons system add that 215 million total the extant nunn lugar assistance which has been flowing about 150 million for some overall safety improvements for various kinds equipment and safety measures that have been working out with the russians over the last couple years this area where will going lot more work with not only the russians but with the ukrainians kazhaks and belarussians belarus for example has just the last couple weeks received million funds for safety security and dismantlement programs belarussian territory and this was the wake their ratification start agreement accede npt are working very hard with all the parties the lisbon protocols and will continue work very hard with them and look upon these three recent agreements with russia very important step that process the opic funds that for the field kazhakstan and conoco already signed this deal with kazhakstan why you feel now necessary the same one why you feel necessary senior administration official not the same deal chevron signed deal with kazhakstan the tenges oil field this new investment project polar lights oil development and renovation project and being announced today completely new can you tell more about what involved senior administration official yes conoco like other american oil companies has been searching for ways two things one prospect for new oil siberia west siberia and two try get into the business renovating oil wells and renovating pipelines both oil and gas russia the objective here obviously take advantage the natural resources russia increase energy production which will turn increase hard currency revenues which what russia needs think this deal very very good development for russia the russians well and good for american company and the american government has played leading role pulling this together through the credit facility opic and through the loan guarantee search and also renovate fields that are already there senior administration official that right that point should other american companies expect get administration support for such deals should they now the and try get the money out the billion senior administration official well you know part the government and various parts the government have been pushing including the state department and the white house for this deal consummated and think will and arrive this agreement april 14th there will billion financing available for american companies sell their equipment and sell their services that should take all the rest the deals and their won and their will there won support for opic sort deals such this conoco senior administration official there tremendous amount interest the part american oil and gas companies invest russia think that the oil and gas facility the billion facility once concluded will soak lot that interest but think the interest may even extend beyond that and the government will respond what the current year budget costs that billion agreement should forward and there any current year budget costs senior administration official have refer you for that don know the details that the concessional food sales there any current year costs that delayed until the years which the payments are due senior administration official the concessional food sales are from food for progress which usda program usda has the funds don need back the congress expend those funds there will hit the budget refer you usda and omb for the details that can you talk about the democracy corps and the private sector how many folks are going involved that senior administration official why don start with the democracy corps first think the administration felt coming into office that there were literally thousands organization private organizations the united states that one way another were working the goal trying achieve democratization russia helping farmer farmer basis and there were literally government agencies that had variety programs this area and the administration felt the president felt was important try draw all these initiatives together under one group give some coherence the efforts and give some impetus the efforts and this presidential initiative will headed ambassador tom simons who will soon take his duties the coordinator for assistance the former soviet union and very hopeful that might use this democracy corps not only draw upon the resources our own government but the resources the american private sector and schools and communities across the nation any kind commitment yet any kind word yet and any new money that needs appropriated besides the 300 million the president talked about senior administration official the administration requesting additional funds 700 million what the president has done this weekend consult really intensively yesterday with president yeltsin about additional measures the united states could take some these areas support reform consulting with the congress when returns washington consulting also with the other ally governments and make decision that time two questions about the 700 billion agricultural money first all thought was the sort consensus that what russia did not need was more loans for food why did you decide that way secondly could you explain agriculture has been stopped from making further loans for food because russia inability pay how does this fit into that situation senior administration official you know the united states for long time has been major supplier grains and food commodities agricultural products russia think between 1991 and had extended little bit history here about billion credits credit guarantees through the commodity credit corporation that was the principal vehicle ensure the sale american grain products december last year the russian government stopped its payments that program they are now arrears that program and therefore law the united states cannot continue that program and the president working with secretary espy and other officials the cabinet looked for other ways that could promote american grain sales and think have two ways that announced today 194 million grant food assistance through the food for progress program but not have sufficient authority spend 700 million grant food and looked for concessional loan program think everybody agrees that russia that short term loan program for russia would not make sense now but long term concessional loan program would and that what this program will provide once the final details are worked out for six seven year grace period payments principal and then from years seven through which the life the deal will provide for concessional rates interest generally around three four percent and believe and the russian government believes this good deal for them because will avoid the imperative early payments and put them into the out years but will also continue this very important grain relationship which important for them and important for the american farm community gather from what you say that this could make explicit the russians failure pay the interest ecc loan does not any way affect this kind loan going through that right senior administration official let explicit about that are prevented under the law from continuing the commodity credit corporation short term credit program because russia arrearages the united states all you know about those arrearages they total about think around 640 million usda can give you exact figure having taken that into consideration and wanting preserve american market share and long term grain relationship wanting respond specific request from the russian government for major food assistance knowing that couldn take from the grant programs because don have sufficient authority there looked food for progress which program used great effect other parts the world and consulted with the russian government and arrived this solution think the russians are pleased because provides them with the food but also gives them little bit relief the short term payments where those funds actually come from senior administration official they come from the food for progress program which program under usda authority usda has the authority spend these funds not need back the congress for these funds and want make that general point again everything this package the billion package comprises funds that have already been allocated and appropriated the congress the administration can begin spend these monies tomorrow and very important our eyes that expend all the funds this year that meet these commitments and are confident able how did you arrive the figure 700 million does that max out that program did you actually have range from senior administration official there reason for the reason was that the russian government told that about the amount grain that they needed between now and harvest time and the idea that would begin the shipments probably 100 million per month from now until the harvest the autumn which time russia won require the same level food imports from the west would imagine there going some considerable envy and jealousy the part some the other republics because the size and the scope this with russia have you given any consideration advancing negotiations for the same kinds projects with the ukraine with georgia with some the other republics senior administration official yes very conscience the fact that also have interest extending american support the other countries the former soviet union have told ourselves and have planned that the area technical assistance the grant technical assistance that you see roughly percent the funding will russia and roughly percent the other countries the area food sales have been active with ukraine grant food assistance with georgia and armenia will continue that and think fair say that after this summit will back and look all our programs with the other countries ensure that they are adequate and they are productive and they hard hitting has anything happened the summit lead american energy companies and other companies believe that russia going more user friendly toward them terms taxing legalities bureaucracy senior administration official well one our primary objectives coming into this summit was highlight not only the economic agenda but also trade and investment and like refer the point made the beginning convinced talking about this problem the problem how support russia long term convinced that collection western governments have the financial resources over the next decade fuel the continuation reform that only the private sector can that look our own society and see tremendous capability resources the oil and gas sector very good match with what the russians need now which financial investment the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new technology and new capital finance new production that what the russian government has told wants and that why have made such major emphasis that why trade and investment was prominent issue the first day these talks and fact figured prominently last night the meeting between president yeltsin and president clinton and hoping that together might send strong signal the american business community that support their efforts invest russia that the united states through and opec and the department commerce will there support them question yeltsin any position deliver making russia more senior administration official think would note that president yeltsin prime minister chernomyrdin worked for years the russian oil and gas sector will now chair high level commission with the vice president vice president gore try break through the barriers that currently exist western investment the oil and gas sector believe have commitment make that committee important committee and looking forward the work what type mechanism already place administer the private sector portion the program and will the directly involved the tail end distribution the actual funds the money simply turned over the russian government for distribution their will senior administration official are you talking about the variety programs listed here depends the program itself most cases though are either working through american pbos american government agencies ensure that the money obviously well spent that the money gets the intended source that obligation have the congress ensure the money well spent and that can account for the money have done that the last couple months intensively and will continue for each these programs but they are all quite different for instance the area grant food and medical assistance for grant food carried out through usda and usda accounts for the delivery the food for grant medical assistance been working through project hope which private organization for the housing for instance the resettlement russian officers working with group american pbos some the democratization projects working directly with russian private individuals and private foundations working with journalists russia media project that you may have noticed literally have here different activities under all these rubrics and they all going carried out slightly different ways some directly with the russian government some with russian citizens the jackson vanik restrictions that remain and the cocom restrictions that remain can you tell what the president has that senior administration official well george noted yesterday president yeltsin raised these irritants the relationship the president has noted that think fair say will back now our own government when return washington and look both these questions and get back the russian government you were not prepared for these questions when you got here senior administration official were prepared for these questions looked them but not prepared make quick decision this weekend they require let just explain particularly jackson vanik they require consultation with the congress they require consultation with the american jewish community and very sensitive those concerns and want back and talk them before take any action this package designed that you will not have congress for anything this point senior administration official said the beginning the advantage this particular package that all the funds have been allocated and appropriated the congress the administration will not have back the congress seek any additional authority fund any these efforts effect they can all begin tomorrow and know that many the agencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow and that the advantage this particular initiative this the president says long term long haul thing and members congress are this moment heading for moscow why aren you talking about going congress and suggesting the president russia that you are prepared congress for various things senior administration official think been clear about that the president discussing this weekend with president yeltsin some additional ideas that have for american funding additional projects and ideas that has have major congressional delegation that left last night headed representative gephardt and want consult with that delegation and other members congress before doing anything and also want consult with our allies that where stands now been told repeatedly that number these items represent different new ways spending the money already appropriated could you just tick off which these items represents reprogramming least spending money ways that was not previously set senior administration official think that said that these are all projects that either congress had allocated money for through the freedom support act there were some funds that were left over from and this administration took office and had some new ideas about how the funds might expended didn use just the freedom support act funds the funds went into some the agency allocations opic and usda and tried look for creative ways further our programs and example that the food for progress concessional loans had hit brick wall with another type funding through usda could not forward legally and looked for more creative way ensure continued american market share and ensure continued grain sales and think found where for example are you getting the money for this russian officer resettlement senior administration official that from the freedom support act funds other words all the money being directly spent new ways speak senior administration official most the grant projects that you see you look the general chart the second chart broken down into grant and credits and you look under grants the technical cooperation projects that total 281 million that almost all freedom support act funding little bit leftover funds from fiscal year the nunn lugar funds course you know about the legislative history those funds cooperation senior administration official from don have the exact figure was not considerable figure could you tell please has anything happened here this weekend that will break the log jam between ukraine and russia over start for start and result what happened here senior administration official both presidents president yeltsin and president clinton will discussing this issue this morning fact haven yet gotten security and arms control related issues that will this morning session know that president clinton will very strongly reinforcing that this top priority for been talking the russians and the ukrainians over the last couple weeks about ways that might help facilitate the discussions between them this point this has been very important negotiation that been going essentially between moscow and kiev and are the point now essentially discussing with them there are ways that could contribute this discussion help move things forward essentially but terms what coming out this weekend don yet know couple hours know just follow the financing here any this robbing peter pay boris since all current year appropriations have you taken from anyplace that been earmarked and put into this fund senior administration official there are smoke and mirrors here and think important point note could have given you page assistance numbers that included out year funding going make long term commitment many these projects for instance the enterprise funds the privatization effort the housing effort and already talked the russians about our long term commitment could have put really big numbers and this could have been bigger package but wanted make point this package funds that have and going what say going and the president feels very strongly about that the past there legacy that the western governments the combination governments put large budget figures and for any number reasons not able meet them determined and the president determined carry out every single program this package and but have longer term commitment and that part the discussions economics this weekend looking for russian ideas what can most effectively support reform and told them that have commitment some these programs beyond this fiscal year taken way from any senior administration official haven okay the question have reprogrammed any these funds have taken from other countries pay for programs russia the answer have not done terms funding there available monies left and you simply find creative way find money somewhere else doesn that fact support the theory senior administration official not all don think does that particular example and the example grain sales the commodity credit corporation credit guarantee program was short term loans that russia had pay back within months you all know about russia debt problem and russia was unable meet those commitments looked for way two things meet russia requirement for grain they net grain importer massive scale and also meet our objective making sure that the american farmers have chance sell their products russia and simply look for another way finance that and have legislative authority this program has been successful other areas had not tried before the former soviet union but thought should now isn this really the bush clinton aid package for russia since these funds were really first derived initiatives put forward president bush senior administration official don think that fair characterization lot these funds were appropriated the congress 1991 1992 this administration took office and inherited some obligations that the bush administration had made but had long six seven week review this program decided meet the commitments that had been made the previous administration but have gone well beyond them funding the enterprise fund which was just idea but the idea had not been filled out with program there was number attached grouping together some projects and trying make them into coherent whole the privatization effort would say another clinton initiative further listened the russian government and listened the russian military who told that the resettlement their officers was important them for political and economic and social reasons and president clinton has responded that and are making long term commitment that beyond this demonstration project going figure out way much more trying settle those officers would also say that the president has given impetus all the agencies think much more broadly about what can democratization because there have some experience and some comparative advantage that lends itself the russian experience and calling for the creation democracy corps which another new initiative hopeful that can take the resources the private sector well the american government achieve that objective would not characterize that way all and most you know career civil servant was the last administration very familiar with what the last administration did and would characterize this clinton assistance package for russia there been lot criticism that aid the past has not gotten the people there anything this outside the ombudsman that will guarantee that this money will not just disappear because being administered the russian government senior administration official think that know that the president and other senior officials our government are concerned that american money spent wisely and that get the source that intended for which intended and going take great care aid and the state department will take great care making sure that the funds are expended properly and that they reaching their source would not that this package not simply package support solely the russian government some these projects especially democratization and exchanges are going worked out directly with russian private individuals with businesses the private enterprise support another example that senior administration official could just add word this point with regard the ssd related programs one area that been looking very very closely consideration actually using russian firms subcontracting for these kinds programs they would working very closely course with the american firms who would the prime contractors but this fine example think more imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some that funding down the grassroots level down the ground russia but the same time ensuring that spent efficiently and for the purposes for which was intended when would the democracy corps start exactly when you see this happening how would get off the ground senior administration official well the president today calling for the creation democracy corps think fair say that going work out its framework over the next couple weeks ambassador simons takes his duties may 1st but effect already started because over the last couple weeks the administration has begun reach out people the private sector who have come asking help facilitate their activities russia and said that will helpful also tried kind coordinate much more effective way the activities our own government have agencies that are active russia one way another think makes sense draw them together and focus their efforts excuse how much this billion will actually spent the united states american made goods senior administration official don have any figures for you now but perhaps could try work something the next couple days that this figure larger than the figure that has been the press did this program grow yesterday result the discussions have just been that far off the mark senior administration official think unfortunately the press has been little bit off the mark and sorry say that this package president clinton put work about seven weeks ago this package and was briefed intensively this contributed lot the intellectual leadership this package contributed lot the ideas the package and think fair say that had this rough package worked out about two weeks ago have been refining ever since spent couple days last week going over with the russian government both the embassy washington and the government moscow through our own embassy and been evolving but this particular package has been together for about two weeks where yeltsin input into this then there was much talk before about the president wanted get yeltsin views about specifically what was needed and forth that the out years senior administration official both president yeltsin has several occasions told for instance that support for the creation private businesses important him that the resettlement russian military officers important and that first and foremost the effort privatize the state industries important them and what did was try make those the centerpiece our technical assistance part the package listened him the privatization effort have been working with the russian government for months this trying work out all the details the russian government most these programs was involved every step the way but let get the other part your question the president also using this weekend talk about broader set initiatives that might undertake and looking for his ideas the president has brought his own ideas the table for instance energy and the environment and housing but looking for russian ideas not need consult with the congress and need consult with the other allied governments that are also active there essentially nothing that happened the last day and half that measurably altered the package that you came with senior administration official this particular package said was worked out and was ready about two weeks ago have since then consulted with the russian government the final stages its development and this weekend primarily talked about future about what more the united states and other western countries can support reform russia which our base objective here noticed that you that money appropriated train bankers and businessmen and officers can you tell what about job training for workers who are displaced privatization senior administration official you right have program train russian young russians banking and financial services the united states part the housing initiative not just build housing units retrain russian officers who are retiring into other professions money for job training for workers whose jobs are disappearing because privatization senior administration official have not yet allocated any money for that why not the million going build 450 housing units isn that lot money per unit given what the western dollar will buy the former soviet union senior administration official you want housing the right way not just the building the framework house you got think about all the utilities you got think about the purchase land you got think about sewage and gas and electricity and forth and also retraining not enough put retired officer coming out riga tallin vilnius house western russia think have obligation try retrain those officers well this responding request from the russian government the million will retrain senior administration official that right are you talking about apartment buildings single senior administration official talking about single individual dwellings you saying that only 450 families will served this senior administration official what want thought pointed out earlier this demonstration project what didn want given the experience that the germans and the turks and the italians have had building housing western russian did not want leap into with huge amount money what want work over the next couple months and try figure out with american organizations the private sector the best way get this job done noted that have long term commitment that and would expect that would put lot more money into this the future but want wisely want spend the money wisely what about this program that convinces you that will protect russia reforms and that russia will position may back the money they supposed pay back especially considering their other debt problem senior administration official well look think important note that the united states its own does not have the capability fuel continuation russian reform got collective western effort and looking our allies more well but beyond that really what the russians that going decide the fate reform can simply play role and feel have obligation which consistent with our national interests did the president say that the value the contribution was that would create security and prosperity for the united states what about this program that does this senior administration official think you have back the fundamental objective our policy toward russia and that want everything can support the continuation reform are convinced that reformers stay power then able continue the drawdown nuclear forces foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction which are the three benefits the united states from reform russia not simple question you can just say that this program the answer long term question and have make long term commitment and then the question russia ability repay what convinces you they able pay seven years from now senior administration official well the russian government has made commitment repay and what hoping that reform continues and they can continue improve their oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency revenues that russia will position six seven years from now pay back those loans substantial government government loan ever gotten into with the russians senior administration official don want answer authoritatively that don back years this but the last four five years yes because the previous way that financed grain exports was really just ensure private bank loans this different type effort government loans any other sector that you recall know wasn done senior administration official think fair say this new and unique effort end10 pdt

 |text from cpage two step seas upenn edu carter page subject reason revelation organization university pennsylvania lines 130 article apr 1993 28309 athos rutgers edu trajan stephen mcintyre writes article apr 1993 17541 athos rutgers edu writes can only reply with what says timothy not here discount parts the bible rather here only discount the notion revelation the author timothy told what thought was the truth based his belief god his faith jesus the resurrected son and his readings the old testament but again what had been revealed him was based best second hand information given friends and authors who may not have given the whole truth who may have exaggerated bit first all the original poster misquoted the reference from tim the author was paul and his revelations were anything but best second hand and came about that saul journeyed was approaching damascus and suddenly light from heaven flashed around him and fell the ground and heard voice saying him saul saul why are you persecuting and said who art thou lord and said jesus whom you are persecuting acts nas paul received revelation directly from the risen jesus pretty cool became closely involved with the early church the leaders which were followers jesus throughout his ministry earth now you may say the holy spirit revealed these things unto him and could into that argument but you hard pressed convince that the holy spirit exists agree don believe anyone but the spirit would able convince you the spirit exists please don complain about this being circular know but really can anything the natural world explain the supernatural this why revelation necessary the authors the bible additionally what has written again second hand info were given the spirit and still carries the chance not true the spirit part god how much closer the source can you get the greek timothy which sometimes translated inspired god literally means god breathed other words god spoke the actual words into the scriptures many theologians and bible scholars james boice one that can remember off hand get quite annoyed the dryness and incompleteness inspired god the only way you would able escape this notion second hand info have had the entire bible written god himself and tell the truth studied the bible extensively and have yet hear scholars who have put forth objective evidence showing god the first author this collection books that what the verse taken from timothy was all about the continuity book written over span 1500 years more than authors from all walks life testimony the single authorship god and for reason read what says corinthians about human wisdom basically says that human wisdom useless when compared with what god has written for our learning you knew jesus well you know the bible you realize reasoned out the law and the prophets for the common man what source you claim have discovered which has information superior historicity the bible certainly not josephus writings the writings the gnostics which were third century the earliest and though some claim jesus was was human with all the human wisdom the apostle paul set out criticize yet would you not embrace the idea that jesus was wise jesus was fully god well that why assert that wise realise that you may not accept the authority the bible this unfortunate say the least because there other way learning about god and christ and god purpose with the earth than reading the bible and searching out its truth for yourself for your information was raised without any knowledge god the time some the faithful

 |text from rexlex fnal fnal gov subject assurance hell organization fnal net lines 139 dreamed that the great judgment morning had dawned and the trumpet had blown dreamed that the sinners had gathered for judgment before the white throne what weeping and wailing the lost were told their fate they cried for the rock and the mountains they prayed but their prayers were too late the soul that had put off salvation not tonight get saved and time now think religion alas had found time die and saw great white throne now some have protest saying that the fear hell not good for motivation yet jesus thought was paul thought was paul said knowing therefore the terror the lord persuade men today too much our evangelism nothing but soft soap and some nothing but evangelical salesmanship don tell people anymore that there such thing sin that there such place hell jayne has said this doesn mean have come strong hit people over the head with baseball bat yet the fact remains there place called hell place fearful that god died save from having experience whatever you christians should whatever can win people the lord for other reason keep them from going outer darkness jesus tells that didn prepare hell for people prepared for the devil and his angels where the bible read anywhere that god predestined anybody hell moody use say that the elect are the whosoever will and the nonelect are the whosoever wont whether not that theologically sound couldn defend but its practical jesus said the people israel would not now some you may not students the bible heck some you may not christians have you ever said somebody don believe hell believe the religion jesus but did you know that jesus talked more about hell than did about heaven believe the religion the sermon the mount you find hell taught jesus the sermon the mount you read that jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire several times talks about hell and about judgment fact over and over the synoptics matthew mark and luke jesus talks about hell not isaiah not moses not john the baptist though did but jesus the son god the great beloved one preached about hell because loved people and didn want see them there now there hell then jesus preached vain was our lord jesus not some angry baptist preacher that said where the worm never dies and where the fire never goes out jesus said that was jesus who called hell furnace fire was jesus that used the word condemnation and this the condemnation that men love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil jesus said that how can get across you that loving dying jesus preached about hell not only that but went through hell that what calgary was all about when lord was the cross darkness fell called hell outer darkness you have this idea that hell place where the gamblers are gambling over here the drunks are getting drunk over there and the prostitutes are prostituting their bodies over there that not what hell hell not party there fellowship there called outer darkness outer away from god darkness god light when was the cross was made sin for you and for god treated jesus the way sinners have treated that sobering thought son would say awesome thought god god why hast thou forsaken hell isolation there fellowship hell there friendship hell there loving embrace hell there hand shake hell there word encouragement hell thirst goes much deeper than physical thirst hell eternal craving with satisfaction the man whose life was lived for drugs will crave eternally the man whose life was lived for the lust woman body will crave eternally and not satisfied one theologian has put this way and think deserves merit what hell hell just the kind environment that matches the internal condition the lost recent post was trying remember the founder the word life ministries remembered his name jack wertzen and found that the illustration that gave wasn his his illustration was that was talking his barber and his barber wife and daughter had just recently been saved and was commenting about jack they sing these songs and read bible verses and their praising this and that can stand jack you think god would send hell jack answered saying yes think would course the barber said what you mean that well you can stand living home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises god now what would you heaven where they for eternity you miserable because god loves you put you where would match what you really are makes man think the crucifixion jesus christ fact that necessitates the eternal existence hell because the cross performed eternal act don ask how don know but god and the infinite eternal and when died died infinite eternal death that eternal act that purchased eternal life for the whosoever wills suffered eternal judgment lot people would like detour around hell saying everybody going saved eventually universalism bible says separate them the sheep from the goats after you die there probationary period which god prepares you for heaven bible says that appointed unto men once die and then comes judgment some the cultist believe annihilation after you die sssswish just like mosquito you squished out rev are told that their eternal existence hell just there heaven don enjoy making these kind statements and maybe you don enjoy listening them but have preach the entire word god there place called hell could give one verse scripture that could give any hope that people aren going there give you but haven found that fact that there place called hell the fact that our god god holiness and must judge sin the fact that has made the kind creatures are and therefore responsible the fact that has placed uni verse that has purpose and design behind the fact that sin such awful thing and the fact that god himself went through hell save from hell leads two applications already mentioned you are christian you must worn others its not good enough stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just around the bend the bridge out knowing therefore the terror lord persuade men you haven accepted jesus are your savior you taking awful chance say the jehovah witnesses who longer frequent door you are right and wrong then will have lived good life and will die and cease exist but right and you are wrong then you will die and suffer eternal damnation don mean make fun this point but its like dirty harry said you got ask yourself feel lucky well you man got know his limitations don one the whosoever wont because while was yet sinner died

distribution lines 115 dean falcione posting from jrmst pitt edu writes wrote when the pens got mario granted there was big publicity etc etc and interest was immediately generated gretzky did the same thing for however imnsho neither team would have seen marked improvement attendance the team record did not improve the year before lemieux came pittsburgh finished with points following his arrival the pens finished with and points with couple stanley cups thrown was this point the pens attendance was near capacity out sellouts yet they hadn made the playoffs since 1982 how you explain 6th place team breaking attendance records when they haven been the playoffs years mario lemieux the explanation imho you could make case that the expectation improving team that would make the playoffs the reason funny you should mention this exactly the case was going make but think the reason lemieux had 168 point season and was the first non gretzky win the hart and ross since 1980 people turned out watch him play will grant that star like mario will draw fans even the team sucks but this short term only still not think the attendance increase will last unless the team winning competitive improving butt kicking one pittsburgh was still getting better people continued support them they suddenly dropped say points you have knee surgery for some the people jumping off the bandwagon also the following year the pens had points not numbers came from the nhl guide and record book they made the transaction try and build winner around mario that true but the improvement attendance came before they started doing this coffey late 1987 and before they even had playoff bound team doubling attendance occured 1984 from the previous year increase from points points not going that the arrival mario lemieux what did you can give the credit mario since deserves but point that wasn mario himself but was the expectation things come winning team that created being the next great hockey superstar and before anybody jumps and says nit picking and mincing words back and read from where this thread started might help think about what would through fan mind who suddenly found interest mario and the pens was gee mario lemieux amazing watch him play was gee now got kick ass guy our side watch him play think was the latter similar thing happened before gretzky arrival about 12000 per game after constant sellouts they are still selling out every game despite showing little improvement since gretzky first year there how you explain people are going see gretzky they certainly aren going see winner they haven got winner they had much better teams their past history than they currently have yet they didn draw well then don think this accurate the tickets sell but people don the games think this thread has already been discussed season ticket holders don always use their tickets effect after the kings initial success following gretzky arrival points same source and corresponding attendance jump there has been effective drop attendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much whether not the kings are winner debatable claim that since gretzky arrival they have the very least been competitive also claim that mcnall has made stupid move trying reassemble the oiler dynasty but that another story and included only because don like mcnall anyway mcnall did some heavy marketing around gretzky and that undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising sales etc but said when the kings have been there little tailspins over the past couple years there have been empty seats the forum even the tickets were sold think the case lemieux gretzky the player can transcend winning the major drawing power for the short term imo although think that inevitable that the team will improve with player such lemieux gretzky simply because they make people around them better but winning sure hell helps well least are full agreement here this does not make roger point any more valid but the jets aren are you saying roger has ever had valid point couldn resist getting huge jump productivity yet they are getting huge jump attendance this due the emergence teemu selanne they have the 17th best record hockey sure hell isn because they are winning yes but they are doing worse than last year think the same type reasoning applied new pittsburgh fan applies all the extra people showing winnipeg games difficult predict but you think that the jets miss the playoffs next season that the year after they will maintain their attendance levels seriously doubt because that case the expectation improving team would gone with without selanne did provide the example rocket ismail and the toronto argonauts the cfl did you leave out because you don know much about the cfl that the case then fair enough but isn the case then curious hear your explanation
