### Outline
These are the topics of Medium articles to appear from Feb 5 to Apr 7, 2018 (every Monday). The articles (Medium "stories" in a ["Publication"](https://medium.com/open-machine-learning-course)) are in English :uk:. The Kaggle [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/vowpal-wabbit-tutorial-blazingly-fast-learning) "Vowpal Wabbit tutorial: blazingly fast learning" can serve as a demonstration of our materials. 
All articles in Russian are already published and are given here with :ru: icons (clickable). If you don't read Russian, still math, code and figures can give you an idea of what's going on. But all these articles are already translated into English and will be published on Medium from Feb 5 to Apr 7, 2018 :pencil:
