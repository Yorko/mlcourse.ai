:exclamation: The course in English started on Feb. 5, 2018 as a series of articles (a ["Publication"](https://medium.com/open-machine-learning-course) on Medium) with assignments and Kaggle Inclass competitions. Fill in [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lejiyldtlHxwwDpWiEqFmaUFUOVfkm9BMjoZurR895c) to participate. :exclamation:

### Outline
These are the topics of Medium articles to appear from Feb 5 to Apr 7, 2018 (every Monday). The articles (Medium "stories" in a ["Publication"](https://medium.com/open-machine-learning-course)) are in English :uk:. The Kaggle [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/vowpal-wabbit-tutorial-blazingly-fast-learning) "Vowpal Wabbit tutorial: blazingly fast learning" can serve as a demonstration of our materials. 
All articles in Russian are already published and are given here with :ru: icons (clickable). If you don't read Russian, still math, code and figures can give you an idea of what's going on. But all these articles are already translated into English and will be published on Medium from Feb 5 to Apr 7, 2018 :pencil:

### Rating 
Throughout the course we are maintaining a [student rating](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VlVgHJSQff0huK1hPsyNiImztc7wop0E8Gvw3qO5vBk/). It takes into account credits scored in assignments and Kaggle competitions. Top-10 students (according to the final rating) will be list on a special Wiki page. 

### Community
The discussions between students are held in the #eng_mlcourse_open channel of the OpenDataScience Slack team.
