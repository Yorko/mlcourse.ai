class CaptioningSolver(object):
    """
    A CaptioningSolver encapsulates all the logic necessary for training
    image captioning models. The CaptioningSolver performs stochastic gradient
    descent using different update rules defined in optim.py.

    The solver accepts both training and validataion data and labels so it can
    periodically check classification accuracy on both training and validation
    data to watch out for overfitting.

    To train a model, you will first construct a CaptioningSolver instance,
    passing the model, dataset, and various options (learning rate, batch size,
    etc) to the constructor. You will then call the train() method to run the
    optimization procedure and train the model.

    After the train() method returns, model.params will contain the parameters
    that performed best on the validation set over the course of training.
    In addition, the instance variable solver.loss_history will contain a list
    of all losses encountered during training and the instance variables
    solver.train_acc_history and solver.val_acc_history will be lists containing
    the accuracies of the model on the training and validation set at each epoch.

    Example usage might look something like this:

    data = load_coco_data()
    model = MyAwesomeModel(hidden_dim=100)
    solver = CaptioningSolver(model, data,
                    update_rule='sgd',
                    optim_config={
                      'learning_rate': 1e-3,
                    },
                    lr_decay=0.95,
                    num_epochs=10, batch_size=100,
                    print_every=100)
    solver.train()


    A CaptioningSolver works on a model object that must conform to the following
    API:

    - model.params must be a dictionary mapping string parameter names to numpy
      arrays containing parameter values.

    - model.loss(features, captions) must be a function that computes
      training-time loss and gradients, with the following inputs and outputs:

      Inputs:
      - features: Array giving a minibatch of features for images, of shape (N, D
      - captions: Array of captions for those images, of shape (N, T) where
        each element is in the range (0, V].

      Returns:
      - loss: Scalar giving the loss
      - grads: Dictionary with the same keys as self.params mapping parameter
        names to gradients of the loss with respect to those parameters.

        """
        Construct a new CaptioningSolver instance.

        Required arguments:
        - model: A model object conforming to the API described above
        - data: A dictionary of training and validation data from load_coco_data

        Optional arguments:
        - update_rule: A string giving the name of an update rule in optim.py.
          Default is 'sgd'.
        - optim_config: A dictionary containing hyperparameters that will be
          passed to the chosen update rule. Each update rule requires different
          hyperparameters (see optim.py) but all update rules require a
          'learning_rate' parameter so that should always be present.
        - lr_decay: A scalar for learning rate decay; after each epoch the learning
          rate is multiplied by this value.
        - batch_size: Size of minibatches used to compute loss and gradient during
          training.
        - num_epochs: The number of epochs to run for during training.
        - print_every: Integer; training losses will be printed every print_every
          iterations.
        - verbose: Boolean; if set to false then no output will be printed during
          training.
