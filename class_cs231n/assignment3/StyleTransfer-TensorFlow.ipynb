    "The general idea is to take two images, and produce a new image that reflects the content of one but the artistic \"style\" of the other. We will do this by first formulating a loss function that matches the content and style of each respective image in the feature space of a deep network, and then performing gradient descent on the pixels of the image itself.\n",

We will work with reshaped versions of these feature maps that combine all spatial positions into one dimension. Let $F^\\ell \\in \\mathbb{R}^{M_\\ell \\times C_\\ell}$ be the feature map for the current image and $P^\\ell \\in \\mathbb{R}^{M_\\ell \\times C_\\ell}$ be the feature map for the content source image where $M_\\ell=H_\\ell\\times W_\\ell$ is the number of elements in each feature map.
