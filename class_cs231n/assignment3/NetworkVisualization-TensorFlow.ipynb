If the image has shape `(H, W, 3)` then this gradient will also have shape `(H, W, 3)`; for each pixel in the image, this gradient tells us the amount by which the classification score will change if the pixel changes by a small amount. To compute the saliency map, we take the absolute value of this gradient, then take the maximum value over the 3 input channels; the final saliency map thus has shape `(H, W)` and all entries are nonnegative.\n",
