</div><br>

Here we discuss various approaches to work with time series: what data preparation is necessary, how to get short-term and long-term predictions. We walk through various types of time series models, from simple moving average to gradient boosting. We also take a look at the ways to search for anomalies in time series and discuss the pros and cons of these methods.

1\. Read the following two articles:
 - ["Time series analysis in Python"](https://mlcourse.ai/articles/topic9-part1-time-series/) (same in a form of a [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/topic-9-part-1-time-series-analysis-in-python))
 - ["Predicting future with Facebook Prophet"](https://mlcourse.ai/articles/topic9-part2-prophet/) (same in a form of a [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/topic-9-part-2-time-series-with-facebook-prophet))
 
2\. Watch a [video lecture](https://youtu.be/_9lBwXnbOd8) 

3\. Complete [demo assignment 9](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/assignment-9-time-series-analysis) where you'll get hands dirty with ARIMA and Prophet, and (opt.) check out the [solution](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/a9-demo-time-series-analysis-solution)

## Bonus Assignment 9. Time series analysis

In this assignment, we'll engineer some features and apply an ML model to a time series prediction task.
