The following 5 articles may form a small brochure, and that's for a good reason: linear models are the most widely used family of predictive algorithms. These articles represent our course in miniature: a lot of theory, a lot of practice. We discuss the theoretical basis of the Ordinary Least Squares method and logistic regression, as well as their merits in terms of practical applications. Also, crucial concepts like regularization and learning curves are introduced. In the practical part, we apply logistic regression to the [task](https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/catch-me-if-you-can-intruder-detection-through-webpage-session-tracking2) of user identification on the Internet, it's a Kaggle Inclass competition a.k.a "Alice".

## Bonus Assignment 4. Kaggle Competition. User Identification with Logistic Regression (beating baselines in the "Alice" competition) 

Here you'll be guided through working with sparse data, feature engineering, model validation, and the process of competing on Kaggle. The task will be to beat baselines in that ["Alice" Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/catch-me-if-you-can-intruder-detection-through-webpage-session-tracking2). That's a very useful assignment for anyone starting to practice with Machine Learning, regardless of the desire to compete on Kaggle.
