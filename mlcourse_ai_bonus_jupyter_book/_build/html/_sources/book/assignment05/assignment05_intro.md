Yet again, both theory and practice are exciting. We discuss why "wisdom of a crowd" works for machine learning models, and an ensemble of several models works better than each one of the ensemble members. In practice, we try out Random Forest (an ensemble of many decision trees) – a "default algorithm" in many tasks. We discuss in detail the numerous advantages of the Random Forest algorithm and its applications. No silver bullet though: in some cases, linear models still work better and faster.
