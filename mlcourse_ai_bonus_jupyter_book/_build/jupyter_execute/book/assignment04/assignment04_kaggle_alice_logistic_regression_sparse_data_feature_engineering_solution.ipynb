    "Today we will reproduce a couple of baselines in the  Kaggle Inclass competition [\"Catch Me If You Can: Intruder Detection through Webpage Session Tracking\"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/catch-me-if-you-can-intruder-detection-through-webpage-session-tracking2) (a.k.a. \"Alice\") and discuss ideas for further improvement. You'll sense the spirit of Kaggle competitions: brainstorming model or validation scheme improvements, adding new features, implementing new ideas in code, climbing the leaderboard – that's exciting! And that's very useful as well, especially when you're only starting your ML journey. In this assignment, we'll also work with sparse matrices (which is often the only way to work with some types of data, from the computation perspective), train Logistic Regression models, and practice feature engineering. \n",

    "\n",
    "Here we give an intuitive reasoning (a rigorous mathematical justification for one or another aspect in linear models you can easily find on the internet). Consider the features more closely: those of them that correspond to the number of visits to a particular web-site per session vary from 0 to 10. The feature `start_month` has a completely different range: from 201301 to 201412, this means the contribution of this variable is significantly greater than the others. It would seem that problem can be avoided if we put less weight in a linear combination of attributes in this case, but in our case logistic regression with regularization is used (by default, this parameter is `C = 1`), which penalizes the model the stronger the greater its weights are. Therefore, for linear methods with regularization, it is recommended to convert features to the same scale (you can read more about the regularization, for example, [here](https://habrahabr.ru/company/ods/blog/322076/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to do this is standardization: for each observation you need to subtract the average value of the feature and divide this difference by the standard deviation:\n",

    "\n",
    "The following practical tips can be given:\n",
    "- It is recommended to scale features if they have essentially different ranges or different units of measurement (for example, the country's population is indicated in units, and the country's GNP in trillions)\n",
    "- Scale features if you do not have a reason/expert opinion to give a greater weight to any of them\n",
    "- Scaling can be excessive if the ranges of some of your features differ from each other, but they are in the same system of units (for example, the proportion of middle-aged people and people over 80 among the entire population)\n",
    "- If you want to get an interpreted model, then build a model without regularization and scaling (most likely, its quality will be worse)\n",
    "- Binary features (which take only values of 0 or 1) are usually left without conversion, (but)\n",
    "- If the quality of the model is crucial, try different options and select one where the quality is better\n",
