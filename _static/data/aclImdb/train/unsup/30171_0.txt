This was an excellent movie. I personally think it should have been put in the movie theater Well I shouldn't take it that far but it was a good movie. My Favorite actor in Subway Stories actually was Danny Hoch. I'm not even sure why, I think it was because he was cool and laid back. Where as his friend was very hype kind of rowdy and a little drunk. But even then I still liked both characters, and I think their roles fit them well. I also think it was the best story out of all ten stories, which is called "HONEY GETTER". The overall movie was put together very well, and it actually made me visit New York mind you this was my first time visiting. I checked out all the scenes where the stories were shot, and it kind of Felt as if I was in the movie it self, feeling weird like I was in my own little world. Another thing I did was went to the spot where the movie first comes on from the blimp look. It took me a while to find it bit I finally did, and the spot that they show or I should say the view is just right above Union Square. Because if you look real carefully at your tv, you'll notice the foot locker and the dirt on the side which I believe now is a movie theatre called United Artists. Well that pretty much concludes my little story and I enjoyed sharing, I hope maybe you'll notice something in the movie I didn't. And just one last thing I hope that this movie comes out on DVD I can't seem to find it anywhere.
