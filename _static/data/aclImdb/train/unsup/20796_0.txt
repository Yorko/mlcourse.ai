The Three Stooges has always been some of the many actors that I have loved. I love just about every one of the shorts that they have made. I love all six of the Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe, and Curly Joe)! All of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts! In My opinion The Three Stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team! <br /><br />This is funny Three Stooges short with Curly. Dick Curtis and Bert Young have to interesting role here and the two actors play them well. The same goes for Dorothy Comingore, Dorothy Appleby, Lorna Gray, and Kathryn Sheldon! The fishing scenes and the bed scenes with The Stooges are hilarious! Recommended!
