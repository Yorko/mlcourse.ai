How do you review this vile piece of trash. It is completely made up of aftermaths of crashes, suicides and murders all taken from police files. There scenes shown are at some points extremely gory and disgusting. Most notably a scene early on of a motorcycle crash where the riders smashed head has wedged its self between a lamp post and a mesh fence. The film is introduced by Dr Vincent van Gore who tells us he is a professor or gorenology. He obviously reads his dumb and pointless introductions to each section from cue cards. The worst part of this film is the narration. It is given with complete disregard for human life and is extremely offensive. At one point a woman who has hung herself is striped off and the narrator comments on her breast size. It seems he may need a little mental help. The film gets extremely boring very fast as when you have seen one of these scenes you have pretty much seen them all. And after half an hour of the same stuff you become pretty tolerant of the gore and blood onscreen. If you enjoy these mondo films then there are plenty more better ones out there. This one is just boring.<br /><br />4/10
