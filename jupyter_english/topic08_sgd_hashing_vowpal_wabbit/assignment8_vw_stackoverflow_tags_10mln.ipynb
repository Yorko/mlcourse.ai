    "In this task, you will do something that we do every week at Mail.Ru Group: train models on several GBs of data. You might cope with Python in Windows, but we strongly recommend some \\*NIX-system (for instance, with Docker) and use bash utils.\n",
    "A sad, but true, fact is that, if you want to work in the best companies in the world in ML, you will need experience with UNIX bash. Here is an interactive [tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/learn-the-command-line/lessons/environment/exercises/bash-profile) from CodeAcademy on UNIX command line (1-2 hours).\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit your answers through the [web-form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14adHGB-XKtpHlG9JJgog3DUzMUabd4y1YWG3b866m54/edit).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this particular task, you will need Vowpal Wabbit installed (we already have it inside the docker-container of our course. Check out instructions in the README in our course [repo](https://github.com/Yorko/mlcourse_open)). Make sure you have approximately 70 GB of disk space. I have tested the solution on an ordinary Macbook Pro 2015 (8 kernels, 16GB RAM), and the heaviest model was trained in ~ 12 min, so this task is doable with ordinary hardware. Still, if you have plans to rent Amazon servers, right now is a good time to do it."
