    "\n",
    "**[Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)** is a Python library that provides extensive means for data analysis. Data scientists often work with data stored in table formats like `.csv`, `.tsv`, or `.xlsx`. Pandas makes it very convenient to load, process, and analyze such tabular data using SQL-like queries. In conjunction with `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`, `Pandas` provides a wide range of opportunities for visual analysis of tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main data structures in `Pandas` are implemented with **Series** and **DataFrame** classes. The former is a one-dimensional indexed array of some fixed data type. The latter is a two-dimensional data structure - a table - where each column contains data of the same type. You can see it as a dictionary of `Series` instances. `DataFrames` are great for representing real data: rows correspond to instances (examples, observations, etc.), and columns correspond to features of these instances."

    "Therefore, predicting that a customer is not loyal (*Churn*=1) in the case when the number of calls to the service center is greater than 3 and the *International Plan* is added (and predicting *Churn*=0 otherwise), we might expect an accuracy of 85.8% (we are mistaken only 464 + 9 times). This number, 85.8%, that we got through this very simple reasoning serves as a good starting point (*baseline*) for the further machine learning models that we will build. \n",

    "As we move on through this course, recall that, before the advent of machine learning, the data analysis process looked something like this. Let's recap what we've covered:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The share of loyal clients in the dataset is 85.5%. The most naive model that always predicts a \"loyal customer\" on such data will guess right in about 85.5% of all cases. That is, the proportion of correct answers (*accuracy*) of subsequent models should be no less than this number, and will hopefully be significantly higher;\n",
    "- With the help of a simple prediction that can be expressed by the following formula: `International plan = True & Customer Service calls > 3 => Churn = 1, else Churn = 0`, we can expect a guessing rate of 85.8%, which is just above 85.5%. Subsequently, we'll talk about decision trees and figure out how to find such rules **automatically** based only on the input data;\n",
    "- We got these two baselines without applying machine learning, and they’ll serve as the starting point for our subsequent models. If it turns out that with enormous effort, we increase accuracy by only 0.5%, persay, then possibly we are doing something wrong, and it suffices to confine ourselves to a simple \"if-else\" model with two conditions;\n",
    "- Before training complex models, it is recommended to wrangle the data a bit, make some plots, and check simple assumptions. Moreover, in business applications of machine learning, they usually start with simple solutions and then experiment with more complex ones.\n",
