    "## 1. About the course\n",
    "\n",
    "With this article we, [OpenDataScience](http://ods.ai/about), launch an open Machine Learning course. We do not aim at developing another *comprehensive* introductory course on machine learning or data analysis (so it’s not a substitute for fundamental education or online/offline courses/specializations and books). The purpose of this series of articles is to quickly refresh your knowledge and help you find topics for further investigation. Our approach is similar to that of the authors of the [Deep Learning book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/), which starts with a review of mathematics and basics of machine learning – short, concise, with many references to other resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "The course is aimed at a perfect balance of theory and practice, so each topic is followed by an **assignment**. Also, you can take part in several Kaggle Inclass **competitions** held during the course. The course is currently self-paced, but still deadlines are given to motivate the participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syllabus\n",
    "1. Exploratory data analysis with Pandas\n",
    "1. Visual data analysis with Python\n",
    "1. Classification, decision trees and k Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "1. Linear classification and regression\n",
    "1. Bagging and random forest\n",
    "1. Feature engineering and feature selection\n",
    "1. Unsupervised learning: Principal Component Anslysis and clustering\n",
    "1. Vowpal Wabbit: learning with gigabytes of data\n",
    "1. Time series analysis with Python\n",
    "1. Gradient boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prereqiusites\n",
    "Among prerequisites are knowledge of basic concepts from calculus, linear algebra, probability theory and statistics and Python programming skills. If you need to catch up, a good resource will be [Part I](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/part_basics.html) of the \"Deep Learning\" book and various math and Python online courses (for Python actually CodeAcademy will do). More info is available on the corresponding [Wiki page](https://github.com/Yorko/mlcourse_open/wiki/Prerequisites:-Python,-math-and-DevOps).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What software you’ll need\n",
    "As for now, you’ll only need [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) build with Python 3.6 to reproduce the code in the course. Later in the course you’ll have to install other libraries like Xgboost and Vowpal Wabbit.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also resort to the [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/festline/mlcourse_open/) with all necessary software already installed. More info is available on the corresponding [Wiki page](https://github.com/Yorko/mlcourse_open/wiki/Software-requirements-and-Docker-container).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Community\n",
    "The course will be discussed in the OpenDataScience Slack team. Please fill in [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lejiyldtlHxwwDpWiEqFmaUFUOVfkm9BMjoZurR895c/edit) to be invited. The form will ask you several questions about your background and skills, including a couple of math tasks. There is also a [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ods_ai/) designed for students passing the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each article comes with an assignment in a form of a [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) notebook. The task will be to fill in the absent code snippets and choose answers to questions in a Google Quiz form. \n",
    "- Each assignment is due in a week with a hard deadline;\n",
    "- Please discuss the course content (articles and assignments) in comments to articles on Medium\n",
    "- The solutions to assignments will be sent to those who have filled in the corresponding Google forms"

    "## 3. Demonstration of main Pandas methods \n",
    "\n",
    "Well.. There are dozens of cool tutorials on Pandas and visual data analysis. So if you are familiar with these topics – just wait for the 3rd article in a series – there goes machine learning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**[Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)** is a Python library that provides extensive means for data analysis. Data scientists often work with data  stored in table formats like `.csv`, `.tsv`, or `.xlsx`. Pandas makes it very convenient to load, process and analyze such tabular data using SQL-like queries. And in conjunction with `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`, `Pandas` provides a wide range of opportunities for visual analysis of tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main data structures in `Pandas` are implemented with **Series** and **DataFrame** classes. The former is a one-dimensional indexed array of some fixed data type. The latter is a two-dimensional data structure - a table - where each column contains data of the same type. You can see it as a dictionary of `Series` instances. `DataFrames` are great for representing real data: rows correspond to instances (objects, observations, whatever), and columns correspond to features of these instances.\n"

    "Therefore, predicting that customer is loyal (*Churn*=0) in case when the number of calls to the service center is less than 4 and *International Plan* is added (and predicting *Churn*=1 otherwise), we might expect about 85.8% of guesses (we are mistaken only 464 + 9 times). This number 85.8% that we got with very simple reasoning is a good starting point (*baseline*) for the further machine learning models that we will build. \n",

    "In general, before the advent of machine learning, the data analysis process looked something like this. Let's recap:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The share of loyal clients in the sample is 85.5%. The most naive model that always predicts a \"loyal customer\" on such data will guess right in about 85.5% of all cases. That is, the proportion of correct answers (*accuracy*) of subsequent models should be no less than this number, and better be significantly higher;\n",
    "- With the help of a simple forecast that can be expressed by the following formula: \"International plan = False & Customer Service calls <4 => Churn = 0, else Churn = 1\", we can expect a guessing rate of 85.8%, which is just above 85.5%. Subsequently, we'll talk about decision trees and figure out how to find such rules automatically based only on the input data;\n",
    "- We got these two baselines without applying machine learning, and they’ll serve as the starting point for our subsequent models. If it turns out that with enormous efforts we increase the share of correct answers by 0.5%, persay, then perhaps we are doing something wrong, and it suffices to confine ourselves to a simple model with two conditions;\n",
    "- Before training complex models it is recommended to twist the data a bit, make some plots and check simple assumptions. Moreover, in business applications of machine learning, they usually start with simple solutions, and then experiment with more complex ones.\n",
