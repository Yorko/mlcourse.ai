    "We will start studying linear models with linear regression. First of all, you must specify a model that relates the dependent variable $y$ to the explanatory factors (or features); for linear models, the dependency function will take the following form: $\\large y = w_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^m w_i x_i$, where $m$ is the number of features. If we add a fictitious dimension $x_0 = 1$ (called _bias_ or _intercept_ term) for each observation, then the linear form can be rewritten in a slightly more compact way by pulling the absolute term $w_0$ into the sum: $\\large y = \\sum_{i=0}^m w_i x_i = \\textbf{w}^\\text{T} \\textbf{x}$. If we have a matrix of $n$ observations, where the rows are observations from a data set, we need to add a single column of ones on the left. We define the model as follows:\n",

    "- $\\epsilon \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ – is a $n \\times 1$ random column-vector, referred to as *error* or *noise*;\n",

    "## 2. Maximum Likelihood Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "One could ask why we choose to minimize the mean square error instead of something else? After all, one can minimize the mean absolute value of the residual. The only thing that will happen, if we change the minimized value, is that we will exceed the Gauss-Markov theorem conditions, and our estimates will therefore cease to be the optimal over the linear and unbiased ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we continue, let's digress to illustrate maximum likelihood estimation with a simple example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people probably remember the formula of ethyl alcohol, so I decided to do an experiment to determine whether people remember a simpler formula for methanol: $CH_3OH$. We surveyed 400 people to find that only 117 people remembered the formula. Then, it is reasonable to assume that the probability that the next respondent knows the formula of methyl alcohol is $\\frac{117}{400} \\approx 29\\%$. Let's show that this intuitive assessment is not only good but also a maximum likelihood estimate. Where this estimate come from? Recall the definition of the Bernoulli distribution: a random variable has a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution\">Bernoulli distribution</a> if it takes only two values ($1$ and $0$ with probability $\\theta$ and $1 - \\theta$, respectively) and has the following probability distribution function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Large p\\left(\\theta, x\\right) = \\theta^x \\left(1 - \\theta\\right)^\\left(1 - x\\right), x \\in \\left\\{0, 1\\right\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This distribution is exactly what we need, and the distribution parameter $\\theta$ is the estimate of the probability that a person knows the formula of methyl alcohol. In our $400$ *independent* experiments, let's denote their outcomes as $\\textbf{x} = \\left(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{400}\\right)$. Let's write down the likelihood of our data (observations), i.e. the probability of observing exactly these 117 realizations of the random variable $x = 1$ and 283 realizations of $x = 0$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Large p(\\textbf{x}; \\theta) = \\prod_{i=1}^{400} \\theta^{x_i} \\left(1 - \\theta\\right)^{\\left(1 - x_i\\right)} = \\theta^{117} \\left(1 - \\theta\\right)^{283}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will maximize the expression with respect to $\\theta$. Most often this is not done with the likelihood $p(\\textbf{x}; \\theta)$ but with its logarithm (the monotonic transformation does not change the solution but simplifies calculation greatly):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Large \\log p(\\textbf{x}; \\theta) = \\log \\prod_{i=1}^{400} \\theta^{x_i} \\left(1 - \\theta\\right)^{\\left(1 - x_i\\right)} = $$\n",
    "$$ \\large = \\log \\theta^{117} \\left(1 - \\theta\\right)^{283} =  117 \\log \\theta + 283 \\log \\left(1 - \\theta\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we want to find such a value of $\\theta$ that will maximize the likelihood. For this purpose, we'll take the derivative with respect to $\\theta$, set it to zero, and solve the resulting equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Large  \\frac{\\partial \\log p(\\textbf{x}; \\theta)}{\\partial \\theta} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} \\left(117 \\log \\theta + 283 \\log \\left(1 - \\theta\\right)\\right) = \\frac{117}{\\theta} - \\frac{283}{1 - \\theta};$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that our intuitive assessment is exactly the maximum likelihood estimate. Now let us apply the same reasoning to the linear regression problem and try to find out what lies beyond the mean squared error. To do this, we'll need to look at linear regression from a probabilistic perspective. Our model naturally remains the same:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Large \\textbf y = \\textbf X \\textbf w + \\epsilon,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "but let us now assume that the random errors follow a centered [Normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) (beware, it's an additional assumption, it's not a prerequisite of a Gauss-Markov theorem):\n",

    "\\end{array}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the examples are taken independently (uncorrelated errors is one of the conditions of the Gauss-Markov theorem), the full likelihood of the data will look like a product of the density functions $p\\left(y_i\\right)$.

    "## 4. Regularization of Linear Regression \n",
    "\n",
    "There are situations where we might intentionally increase the bias of the model for the sake of stability i.e. to reduce the variance of the model $\\text{Var}\\left(\\widehat{f}\\right)$. One of the conditions of the Gauss-Markov theorem is the full column rank of matrix $\\textbf{X}$. Otherwise, the OLS solution $\\textbf{w} = \\left(\\textbf{X}^\\text{T} \\textbf{X}\\right)^{-1} \\textbf{X}^\\text{T} \\textbf{y}$ does not exist since the inverse matrix $\\left(\\textbf{X}^\\text{T} \\textbf{X}\\right)^{-1}$ does not exist. In other words, matrix $\\textbf{X}^\\text{T} \\textbf{X}$ will be singular or degenerate. This problem is called an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-posed_problem\"> ill-posed problem</a>. Problems like this must be corrected, namely, matrix $\\textbf{X}^\\text{T} \\textbf{X}$ needs to become non-degenerate, or regular (which is why this process is called regularization). Often we observe the so-called multicollinearity in the data: when two or more features are strongly correlated, it is manifested in the matrix $\\textbf{X}$ in the form of \"almost\" linear dependence between the columns. For example, in the problem of predicting house prices by their parameters, attributes \"area with balcony\" and \"area without balcony\" will have an \"almost\" linear relationship. Formally, matrix $\\textbf{X}^\\text{T} \\textbf{X}$ for such data is reversible, but, due to multicollinearity, some of its eigenvalues will be close to zero. In the inverse matrix $\\textbf{X}^\\text{T} \\textbf{X}$, some extremely large eigenvalues will appear, as eigenvalues of the inverse matrix are $\\frac{1}{\\lambda_i}$. The result of this vacillation of eigenvalues is an unstable estimate of model parameters, i.e. adding a new set of observations to the training data will lead to a completely different solution. \n",
    "One method of regularization is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikhonov_regularization\">Tikhonov regularization</a>, which generally looks like the addition of a new member to the mean squared error:\n",

    "$$\\Large \\begin{array}{rcl} \n",
    "\\mathcal{L}\\left(\\textbf{X}, \\textbf{y}, \\textbf{w} \\right) &=& \\frac{1}{2n} \\left\\| \\textbf{y} - \\textbf{X} \\textbf{w} \\right\\|_2^2 + \\left\\| \\Gamma \\textbf{w}\\right\\|^2\\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "The Tikhonov matrix is often expressed as the product of a number by the identity matrix: $\\Gamma = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} E$. In this case, the problem of minimizing the mean squared error becomes a problem with a restriction on the $L_2$ norm. If we differentiate the new cost function with respect to the model parameters, set the resulting function to zero, and rearrange for  $\\textbf{w}$, we get the exact solution of the problem.\n",

    "This type of regression is called ridge regression. The ridge is the diagonal matrix that we add to the $\\textbf{X}^\\text{T} \\textbf{X}$ matrix to ensure that we get a regular matrix as a result.\n",

    "Such a solution reduces dispersion but becomes biased because the norm of the vector of parameters is also minimized, which makes the solution shift towards zero. On the figure below, the OLS solution is at the intersection of the white dotted lines. Blue dots represent different solutions of ridge regression. It can be seen that by increasing the regularization parameter $\\lambda$, we shift the solution towards zero.\n",
