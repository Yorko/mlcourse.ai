    "* ability to deploy your own model is an important skill to add to your Data Scientist toolbox.

    "## 2.3. Persisting The Model\n",
    "After the training model have to be persisted. Basically, it's done by serializing the model state from the memory to file on disk in some specific format. It's common to use [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) binary serialization in Python for that, but due to [performance](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_persistence.html) reasons we will use [joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/persistence.html) (which still use pickle internally).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that both pickle and joblib have problems with security - you have to be sure that the file you're trying to deserialize was not replaced by an attacker because it's possible to force Python to execute malicious code during deserialization. You can see how it works with more details [here](https://rushter.com/blog/pickle-serialization-internals/).\n",
    "\n",
    "What exactly have to be persisted in our case? Obviously, the following things need to be saved:\n",
    "* the model itself which is ```LogisticRegression``` estimator in our case - it contains the weights and logic on how to process these weights;\n",
    "* feature processing steps which represented by ```PolynomialFeatures``` and ```StandardScaler``` - saving them will allow us to process date for predictions in exactly the same manner as we did for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not so obvious, but still nice to have:\n",
    "* model version - for our own convenience and to be able to distinguish different models between each other;\n",
    "* incoming feature names or any other info which describe input and/or output data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3.1. scikit-learn Pipelines\n",
    "Before we proceed, let's pretend that we have our ```PolynomialFeatures``` and ```StandardScaler``` as separate objects. In this case we would need to save them and ```LogisticRegression``` as separate entities which introduce too much hassle, especially if our model eventually grow and other feature processing steps will be added.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, there are many good reasons to use the scikit-learn pipelines and here is another one: we can persist just our ```Pipeline``` object and have all of the steps stored as a single entity in one file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3.2. Python and library versions\n",
    "Also when serializing your model you have to be aware that serialized object might not load in different version of Python or with another version of the library, classes of which were serialized. That's why it's always good to fix and keep the Python and all of the related library versions along with the model. We will do it in this tutorial.\n",

    "* serverless deployments using [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) or [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/) - they will allow you to run your model on demand, usually using much less resources and money. It's another great way to deploy proof-of-concepts and small models to production;\n",
