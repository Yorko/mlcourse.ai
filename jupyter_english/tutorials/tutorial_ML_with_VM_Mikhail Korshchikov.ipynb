    "\n",
    " 1. **The first variant:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\tBuy a new hardware. What we have there, oh yes:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\n",
    " - I7-8700k  400 \\$\n",

    " - ssd disk and so on...\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Option 2:** \n",
    "\n",
    "\tСode or computing optimization. A good choice, the right groundwork for the future.\n",
    "    But deadlines-work-study-family... where to find time for all of this?\n",
    "\tPlus, I spend a lot of time in transport (metro-train-transfer) and I want to spend my time effectively. \n",
    "    In addition,  good idea often comes in the most unexpected places and I want to immediately test it.\n",
    "<br/> \n",
    "<br/> \n",
    "3. **From the above, a third option appears** - take a strong hardware in the cloud. And connect with it from any device, always having a powerful beast under the hood. *\"A rom dom dom\" NFS Underground OST.* \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Google Compute Engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, there are many companies whom offer resources for cloud computing. An important aspect for me is that the service must by free of charge, flexy and completeness of the opportunities provided. Therefore, I've choosed Google.\n",

    "\n",
    "There may be several reasons. The most often is a lack of computing resources (memory). And the most annoying thing is that all cells now need to be restarted. When you save the resulting objects in txt or pickle you are the winner. But only practice makes perfect. At the beginning of the learning path, such restarts of the kernel can, in the first place, enrage. Secondly, it takes a lot of time.\n",
