Probably, someone doesn't want to show his name and ID for OpenDataScience community (: . Also I will provide you the link to the graph based on social net with changed info for every person. Our main instrument for graph modeling will be the **NetworkX library** in Python.\n",

    "The nice thing about graphs is that the concepts and terminology are generally intuitive. Nevertheless, here's some basic lingo:\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs are structures that map relations between objects. The objects are referred to as nodes and the connections between them as edges in this tutorial. Note that edges and nodes are commonly referred to by several names that generally mean exactly the same thing:\n",
    "\n",
    "node == vertex == point\n",
    "edge == arc == link\n",
    "\n",
    "    For implement graph in our analysis it's good idea to use some libraries. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Firstly**, it's NetworkX library. NetworkX is the most popular Python package for manipulating and analyzing graphs. Several packages offer the same basic level of graph manipulation, but, most likely, NetworkX is the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Secondly**, it's EoN library. EoN (Epidemics on Networks) is a Python module, that provides tools to study the spread of SIS and SIR diseases in networks (SIR and SIS definition I'll provide in the chapter 6). EoN is built on top of NetworkX.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thirdly**, since we want to get our friendlist from VK, we have to use their API - that means we need some libraries for requests. If you are not VK user, you can change a bit code in this notebook to get your friends, for example, from Facebook. I am sure, that is pretty the same.\n",

    "**Finally**, we will need usual basic libraries you already know (I hope) such as matplotlib, Garbage Collector interface, pandas, etc. \n",

    "    The epidemic model is intellectual source for information diffusion research. The first known mathematical model of epidemiology was formulated by Daniel Bernoulli (1760), when he studied the mortality rates in order to eradicate the smallpox. However, it was not until the early twentieth century, that deterministic modeling of epidemiology started. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Ross (1911) developed differential equation models of epidemics in 1911. Later, Kermack and McKendrick (1927) found the epidemic threshold and they argued that the density of susceptible must exceed a critical value to make the outbreak of an epidemic happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical models developed by epidemic research help clarify assumptions, variables, and parameters for diffusion research, lead to useful concepts (e.g., threshold, reproduction number), supply an experimental tool for testing theoretical conjectures, and forecast epidemic spreading in the future (Hethcote, 2009). Although epidemic models are simplifications of reality, they help us refine our understandings about the logic of diffusion beneath social realities (disease transmission, information diffusion through networks, and adoption of new technologies or behaviors). To understand the epidemic models in a better way, I will review **the basic epidemic models: SI, SIR, SIS**, and the applications in networks.\n",
    "\n",
    " However, despite the many advantages of deterministic models, it can be difficult to include realistic population networks, to incorporate realistic probability distributions for the time spent in the infectious period, and to assess the probability of an outbreak. Thus, the stochastic epidemic simulations, such as stochastic differential equations, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and agent based modeling, have been used to remedy the defect."

    "What have we done while going through this tutorial?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We have explored really different parts of working with Networks: \n",
    "\n",
    "`Firstly, we collected data:`\n",
    "- That was not so easy, perhaps, if you are new with API, or maybe you skipped that part, if you are not VK user. But I think, it's worth reading anyway - you can pick up some usefull ideas for your future possible tasks and researches. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Secondly, we made some kind of preprocessing of data:`\n",
    "- We changed all names and IDs of real people. For this mini-task we had to find and load third-party datasets, and than generate random people set and  map to our real data. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Thirdly, we met with cool library for network's analysis - NetworkX:`\n",
    "- We got acquainted with how to get started with correct implementation of a graph in NetworkX: creation graph from scratch, random graphs, saving, loading, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Although, we didn't go deep into classes and functions of this package (that wasn't purpose of this tutorial), we explored many methods, that you can use right away. Also, after this quick start of using this library you are able to improve skills by your own, just read the documentation, compile other tutorials - and it won't be challenging for you now. \n",
    "\n",
    "- We created a nice function for visualizing graphs, and discovered another easy way. You can always play around with parameters and other built-in functions from the package - visit documentation - and you will find much more interesting techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Fourthly, that was amazing trial to Epidemics modeling!`\n",
    "- We got a bit closer to be familiar with good library EoN: as with NetworkX, we didn't dig everything around this package, but we used if for all ideas that we needed in this tutorial! And for sure, don't be afraid of experimentation - here is a large place for self-improvment in every direction you can think. \n",
    "\n",
    "- We made research about 3 main models, but we did it from theoretical side, for real graph and for random one! We expanded the place for future analysis here - we got many useful instruments, and you can find even more if you are got interested in this theme! I hope so. \n",
    "\n",
    "`N-thly, some recommendations:`\n",
    "- To get deeper into EoN visit official page : https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/epidemicsonnetworks/latest/epidemicsonnetworks.pdf\n",
    "- As you remember, we worked with real graph loaded from social network. I really encourage you to load your own social net and find something good, for beginning: dependencies and clusters. For sure it will be much more interesting, if you load graph of depth not only 2, but 3, 4...(super complex). And since you'll have to load friends - you'll also have to make requests to API - so I recommend you to get familiar with this sphere, if you are not yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "- And talking about social nets, it's totally worth reading for the start: Granovetter's paper \"The Strength of Weak Ties\""
