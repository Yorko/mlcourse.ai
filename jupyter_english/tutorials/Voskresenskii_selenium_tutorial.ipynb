    "Today we will study how to work with one very useful and impressive framework which will help us to scrape websites having dynamic data requests. This framework is called **Selenium** and we can efficiently work with it on Python. The idea laying behind Selenium is very simple -- it allows web developers test their applications before launching them. With help of Selenium, they can emulate the work of browser and check how different elements of their application work from the side of a user.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, apart from giving web developers possibility to check their applications, Selenium can be useful also for data analysts who want to get data from websites with sophisticated internal strucutres. Probably, you faced such situations when you try to collect data with help of Beatiful Soup in Python or any other package and cannot get it because you need to wait some time until data is uploaded to a website from a server. Unfortunately, your script does not know about this feature of a website and tries to ge it at once. Finally, instead of getting desirable data you get blank list. Also, I suppose, sometimes, data analysts want to collect data from websites where you need firstly put some information into text fields or click some buttons. Certainly, you cannot do such actions with help of Beuatiful Soup. My tutorial will show you how to tackle with such issues with help of Selenium.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plan of the workshop is following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We will know how to install Selenium and will cover briefly main terminology \n",
    "2. I will introduce you to the case we are going to solve in the framework of current tutorial\n",
    "2. We will write script with special Selenium functions allowing to interact with a browser\n",
    "3. We will add very simple code collecting data we need with help of BeatifulSoup\n",
    "4. We will write final function combining all our previous steps"

    "\n",

    "*My advise*: choose Firefox for work with Selenium. Initially, I started working with Chrome and found that Chrome sometimes cannot find some elements on webpage which definitely exist. At the same time, Firefox had no any issues with finding these elements. I did not check other browsers though.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of a browser you selected, the algorithm of working with drivers is very similar. First, you download driver (geckodriver for Mozilla Firefox can be found [here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)). Then, you set executable file (*geckodriver.exe*) as an environment variable on your computer (on Windows, you need to add the path to executable file to PATH). That's it. Now, you can work with Selenium. \n",

    "`driver.find_element_by_link_text`\n",

    "In the current workshop, we will be scraping data from [Airbnb](https://ru.airbnb.com/). Airbnb is the website for travelers which sometimes allows you to find cheaper place for living than websites like Booking.com. On Airbnb you are searching not for hotels or hostels but for apartment offered by hosts living in a city you want to visit. Airbnb is based on principles of sharing economy where trust between hosts and guests is supported by reviews technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our task is following. Let's imagine that you and your friend want to travel to London and live there from 15th of March of 2018 to 23rd of May (completely random dates). We do not want to go to the website each day in a hope to find the best offer. Instead of it, we want to write function which will be collecting regularly for us offers from hosts, some characteristics of the apartments and their prices. But as you can see Airbnb website is created well and it has a lot of interactive elements: apart from search fields we have calendars, special buttons for choosing number of guests, children. By using only Beautiful Soup we cannot collect all data we need. Thereby, we, certainly, need Selenium. Let's start!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we now on the main page of Airbnb and we need to choose city, country, dates and number of guests. Obviously, we need to start with place we are going to visit. The best way is to put a city and a country into the search field. For identifying html element of the search field we have special function in our browser called \"Inspect element\". To find it, we need to press right button of a mouse on the element we wanna get and click on Q on our keyboard (look at the picture below)."
