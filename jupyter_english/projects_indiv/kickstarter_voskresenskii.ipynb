    "Before diving into the data analysis and features engineering, let me introduce you to the context of current project. In the project, I am working with data taken from online [platform Kickstarter](https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects). This platform was created specially for crowdfunfing, and any person (or group of persons) can publish idea of any project on it and expect that some interested users of the platform will fund this idea. Usually, funders get some exclusive prizes from creators, and the size of the prize depends on how much money you put into the project. Obviously, not all the projects have a success and get enough money. Therefore, predicting those features which make projects successful becomes very important purpose for data analysts. Well-working models can be very helpful instruments for those innovators who want to try their luck with getting money on the platform."
