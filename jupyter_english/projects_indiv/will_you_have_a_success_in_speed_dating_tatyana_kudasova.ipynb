    "\n",
    "In today’s busy world, finding and dating a romantic partner seems more time consuming than ever. As a result, many people have turned to speed dating as a solution that allows one to meet and interact with a large number of potential partners in a short amount of time. As it turns out, some people actually find a partner during these events, and others don't ever see any of the people they met there. In this project we are exploring what distinguishes those who date after the speed dating ('good, or successful speed daters') from those who don't ('bad speed daters'), and try to predict if a person will be a good or a bad speed dater. So you could try out yourself will the speed dating be helpful for you or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was gathered from 552 participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004 (total 21 events). Participants were students in graduate and professional schools at Columbia University. They were recruited through a combination of mass e-mail and fliers posted throughout the campus and handed out by research assistants. In order to sign up for a speed dating event, interested students had to register at an online web site on which they reported their names and e-mail addresses and completed a pre-event survey. During the events, the attendees would have a four minute \"first date\" with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: attractiveness, sincerity, intelligence, fun, ambition, shared interests. The morning after the speed dating event, participants were sent an e-mail requesting that they complete the follow-up online questionnaire. Most of the speed dating participants completed this follow-up questionnaire in order to obtain their matches. Upon receipt of their follow-up questionnaire responses, participants were sent an e-mail informing them of their match results.\n",
    "Also 3-4 weeks after the speed dating event, participants were asked to fill a survey again. And one answer from this survey we take as a target here - `date_3` - whether a person went to a date with at least one of his/her speed dating matches. All our features will be from pre-event surveys, as our goal is prediction for persons who have never been to such events. For more details, see the speed-dating-data-key.doc for data dictionary and question key. The question key and the data you can find on [Kaggle]: (https://www.kaggle.com/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment).\n",

We've found features that might affect the target variable: foreign status, age, race importance, tv loving, exercise loving, happiness expectation, attributes the participant looks for in his dates (6 total), attributes the participant thinks opposite sex looks for in his dates (6 total) - 18 features. \n",

The task was difficult as there were no features that correlate much with the target, and it is hard to separate those classes. For that we might try some dimensionality reduction algorithms. \n",
