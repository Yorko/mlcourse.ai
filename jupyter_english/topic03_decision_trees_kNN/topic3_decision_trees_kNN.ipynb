    "Before we dive into the material for this week's article, let's talk about the kind of problem that we are going to solve and its place in the exciting field of machine learning. T. Mitchell's book \"Machine Learning\" (1997) gives a classic, general definition of machine learning as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "> A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the various problem settings T, P, and E can refer to completely different things. Some of the most popular tasks T in machine learning are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- classification of an instance to one of the categories based on its features;\n",
    "- regression – prediction of a numerical target feature based on other features of an instance;\n",
    "- clustering – identifying partitions of instances based on the features of these instances so that the members within the groups are more similar to each other than those in the other groups;\n",
    "- anomaly detection – search for instances that are \"greatly dissimilar\" to the rest of the sample or to some group of instances;\n",
    "- and so many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good overview is provided in the \"Machine Learning basics\" chapter of [\"Deep Learning\"](http://www.deeplearningbook.org) (by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville, 2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "Experience E  refers to data (we can't go anywhere without it). Machine learning algorithms can be divided into those that are trained in supervised or unsupervised manner. In unsupervised learning tasks, one has a set consisting of instances described by a set of features. In supervised learning problems, there's also a target variable, which is what we would like to be able to predict, known for each instance in a training set. "

    "#### Example\n",
    "Classification and regression are supervised learning problems. For example, as a credit institution, we may want to predict loan defaults based on the data accumulated about our clients. Here, the experience E is the available training data: a set of instances (clients), a collection of features (such as age, salary, type of loan, past loan defaults, etc.) for each, and a target variable (whether they defaulted on the loan). This target variable is just a fact of loan default (1 or 0), so recall that this is a (binary) classification problem. If you were instead predicting by how much time the loan payment is overdue, this would become a regression problem.\n",
    " \n",
    "Finally, the third term used in the definition of machine learning is a metric of the algorithm's performance evaluation P. Such metrics differ for various problems and algorithms, and we'll discuss them as we study new algorithms. For now, we'll refer to a simple metric for classification algorithms, the proportion of correct answers – accuracy – on the test set.\n",

    "We begin our overview of classification and regression methods with one of the most popular ones – a decision tree. Decision trees are used in everyday life decisions, not just in machine learning. Flow diagrams are actually visual representations of decision trees. For example, Higher School of Economics publishes information diagrams to make the lives of its employees easier. Here is a snippet of instructions for publishing a paper on the Institution portal."

    " \n",
    "A decision tree is often a generalization of the experts' experience, a means of sharing knowledge of a particular process. For example, before the introduction of scalable machine learning algorithms, the credit scoring task in the banking sector was solved by experts. The decision to grant a loan was made on the basis of some intuitively (or empirically) derived rules that could be represented as a decision tree."

    "The decision tree as a machine learning algorithm is essentially the same thing as the diagram shown above; we incorporate a stream of logical rules of the form \"feature $a$ value is less than $x$ and feature $b$ value is less than $y$ ... => Category 1\" into a tree-like data structure. The advantage of this algorithm is that they are easily interpretable. For example, using the above scheme, the bank can explain to the client why they were denied for a loan: e.g the client does not own a house and her income is less than 5,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we'll see later, many other models, although more accurate, do not have this property and can be regarded as more of a \"black box\" approach, where it is harder to interpret how the input data was transformed into the output. Due to this \"understandability\" and similarity to human decision-making (you can easily explain your model to your boss), decision trees have gained immense popularity. C4.5, a representative of this group of classification methods, is even the first in the list of 10 best data mining algorithms (\"Top 10 Algorithms in Data Mining\", Knowledge and Information Systems, 2008.

    " \n",
    "Recall the game of \"20 Questions\", which is often referenced when introducing decision trees. You've probably played this game -- one person thinks of a celebrity while the other tries to guess by asking only \"Yes\" or \"No\" questions. What question will the guesser ask first? Of course, they will ask the one that narrows down the number of the remaining options the most. Asking \"Is it Angelina Jolie?\" would, in the case of a negative response, leave all but one celebrity in the realm of possibility. In contrast, asking \"Is the celebrity a woman?\" would reduce the possibilities to roughly half. That is to say, the \"gender\" feature separates the celebrity dataset much better than other features like \"Angelina Jolie\", \"Spanish\", or \"loves football.\" This reasoning corresponds to the concept of information gain based on entropy."

As you can see, entropy has decreased in both groups, more so in the right group. Since entropy is, in fact, the degree of chaos (or uncertainty) in the system, the reduction in entropy is called information gain.

With that, the entropy of both left and right groups decreased. The process continues up to depth 3. In this visualization, the more samples of the first class, the darker the orange color of the vertex; the more samples of the second class, the darker the blue. At the beginning, the number of samples from two classes is equal, so the root node of the tree is white."

    "Suppose we have a numeric feature \"Age\" that has a lot of unique values. A decision tree will look for the best (according to some criterion of information gain) split by checking binary attributes such as \"Age <17\", \"Age < 22.87\", and so on. But what if the age range is large? Or what if another quantitative variable, \"salary\", can also be \"cut\" in many ways? There will be too many binary attributes to select from at each step during tree construction. To resolve this problem, heuristics are usually used to limit the number of thresholds to which we compare the quantitative variable.\n",

    "## 6. Pros and Cons of Decision Trees and the Nearest Neighbors Method\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- Generation of clear human-understandable classification rules, e.g. \"if age <25 and is interested in motorcycles, deny the loan\". This property is called interpretability of the model.\n",
    "- Decision trees can be easily visualized, i.e. both the model itself (the tree) and prediction for a certain test object (a path in the tree) can \"be interpreted\".\n",
    "- Fast training and forecasting.\n",
    "- Small number of model parameters.\n",
    "- Supports both numerical and categorical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    " \n",
    "- The trees are very sensitive to the noise in input data; the whole model could change if the training set is slightly modified (e.g. remove a feature, add some objects). This impairs the interpretability of the model.\n",
    "- Separating border built by a decision tree has its limitations – it consists of hyperplanes perpendicular to one of the coordinate axes, which is inferior in quality to some other methods, in practice.\n",
    "- We need to avoid overfitting by pruning, setting a minimum number of samples in each leaf, or defining a maximum depth for the tree. Note that overfitting is an issue for all machine learning methods.\n",
    "- Instability. Small changes to the data can significantly change the decision tree. This problem is tackled with decision tree ensembles (discussed next time).\n",
    "- The optimal decision tree search problem is NP-complete. Some heuristics are used in practice such as greedy search for a feature with maximum information gain, but it does not guarantee finding the globally optimal tree.\n",
    "- Difficulties to support missing values in the data. Friedman estimated that it took about 50% of the code to support gaps in data in CART (an improved version of this algorithm is implemented in `sklearn`).\n",
    "- The model can only interpolate but not extrapolate (the same is true for random forests and tree boosting). That is, a decision tree makes constant prediction for the objects that lie beyond the bounding box set by the training set in the feature space. In our example with the yellow and blue balls, it would mean that the model gives the same predictions for all balls with positions >19 or <0."

    "### The nearest neighbors method\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- Simple implementation;\n",
    "- Well studied;\n",
    "- Typically, the method is a good first solution not only for classification or regression, but also recommendations;\n",
    "- It can be adapted to a certain problem by choosing the right metrics or kernel (in a nutshell, the kernel may set the similarity operation for complex objects such as graphs while keeping the k-NN approach the same). By the way, [Alexander Dyakonov](https://www.kaggle.com/dyakonov), a former top-1 kaggler, loves the simplest k-NN but with the tuned object similarity metric;\n",
    "- Good interpretability. There are exceptions: if the number of neighbors is large, the interpretability deteriorates (\"We did not give him a loan, because he is similar to the 350 clients, of which 70 are the bad, and that is 12% higher than the average for the dataset\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- Method considered fast in comparison with compositions of algorithms, but the number of neighbors used for classification is usually large (100-150) in real life, in which case the algorithm will not operate as fast as a decision tree.\n",
    "- If a dataset has many variables, it is difficult to find the right weights and to determine which features are not important for classification/regression.\n",
    "- Dependency on the selected distance metric between the objects. Selecting the Euclidean distance by default is often unfounded. You can find a good solution by grid searching over parameters, but this becomes very time consuming for large datasets.\n",
    "- There are no theoretical ways to choose the number of neighbors – only grid search (though this is often true for all hyperparameters of all models). In the case of a small number of neighbors, the method is sensitive to outliers, that is, it is inclined to overfit.\n",
    "- As a rule, it does not work well when there are a lot of features due to the \"curse of dimensionality\". Professor Pedro Domingos, a well-known member in the ML community, talks about it [here](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf) in his popular paper, \"A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning\"; also \"the curse of dimensionality\" is described in the Deep Learning book in [this chapter](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/ml.html).\n",
