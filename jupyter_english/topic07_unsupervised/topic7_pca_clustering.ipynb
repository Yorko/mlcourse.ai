    "\n",
    "Welcome to the seventh part of our Open Machine Learning Course!  \n",
    "  \n",
    "In this lesson, we will work with unsupervised learning methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering. You will learn why and how we can reduce the dimensionality of the original data and what the main approaches are for grouping similar data points.  \n",

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The main feature of unsupervised learning algorithms, when compared to classification and regression methods, is that input data are unlabeled (i.e. no labels or classes given) and that the algorithm learns the structure of the data without any assistance. This creates two main differences. First, it allows us to process large amounts of data because the data does not need to be manually labeled. Second, it is difficult to evaluate the quality of an unsupervised algorithm due to the absence of an explicit goodness metric as used in supervised learning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common tasks in unsupervised learning is dimensionality reduction. On one hand, dimensionality reduction may help with data visualization (e.g. t-SNE method) while, on the other hand, it may help deal with the multicollinearity of your data and prepare the data for a supervised learning method (e.g. decision trees).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition, theories, and application issues\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis is one of the easiest, most intuitive, and most frequently used methods for dimensionality reduction, projecting data onto its orthogonal feature subspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"right\" src=\"https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bb6/fe7/f06/bb6fe7f06e114bcc9c354a1cb025b966.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally speaking, all observations can be considered as an ellipsoid in a subspace of an initial feature space, and the new basis set in this subspace is aligned with the ellipsoid axes. This assumption lets us remove highly correlated features since basis set vectors are orthogonal. \n",
    "In the general case, the resulting ellipsoid dimensionality matches the initial space dimensionality, but the assumption that our data lies in a subspace with a smaller dimension allows us to cut off the \"excessive\" space with the new projection (subspace). We accomplish this in a 'greedy' fashion, sequentially selecting each of the ellipsoid axes by identifying where the dispersion is maximal.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "> \"To deal with hyper-planes in a 14 dimensional space, visualize a 3D space and say 'fourteen' very loudly. Everyone does it.\" - Geoffrey Hinton\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the mathematical formulation of this process:\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to decrease the dimensionality of our data from $n$ to $k$ with $k \\leq n$, we sort our list of axes in order of decreasing dispersion and take the top-$k$ of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by computing the dispersion and the covariance of the initial features. This is usually done with the covariance matrix. According to the covariance definition, the covariance of two features is computed as follows: $$cov(X_i, X_j) = E[(X_i - \\mu_i) (X_j - \\mu_j)] = E[X_i X_j] - \\mu_i \\mu_j,$$ where $\\mu_i$ is the expected value of the $i$th feature. It is worth noting that the covariance is symmetric, and the covariance of a vector with itself is equal to its dispersion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the covariance matrix is symmetric with the dispersion of the corresponding features on the diagonal. Non-diagonal values are the covariances of the corresponding pair of features. In terms of matrices where $\\mathbf{X}$ is the matrix of observations, the covariance matrix is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Sigma = E[(\\mathbf{X} - E[\\mathbf{X}]) (\\mathbf{X} - E[\\mathbf{X}])^{T}]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick recap: matrices, as linear operators, have eigenvalues and eigenvectors. They are very convenient because they describe parts of our space that do not rotate and only stretch when we apply linear operators on them; eigenvectors remain in the same direction but are stretched by a corresponding eigenvalue. Formally, a matrix $M$ with eigenvector $w_i$ and eigenvalue $\\lambda_i$ satisfy this equation: $M w_i = \\lambda_i w_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The covariance matrix for a sample $\\mathbf{X}$ can be written as a product of $\\mathbf{X}^{T} \\mathbf{X}$. According to the [Rayleigh quotient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_quotient), the maximum variation of our sample lies along the eigenvector of this matrix and is consistent with the maximum eigenvalue. Therefore, the principal components we aim to retain from the data are just the eigenvectors corresponding to the top-$k$ largest eigenvalues of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next steps are easier to digest. We multiply the matrix of our data $X$ by these components to get the projection of our data onto the orthogonal basis of the chosen components. If the number of components was smaller than the initial space dimensionality, remember that we will lose some information upon applying this transformation."

Compare the implementation of K-means and MiniBatch K-means in the [sckit-learn documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_mini_batch_kmeans.html).\n",

    "Here, we assume that the true labels of objects are known. This metric does not depend on the labels' values but on the data cluster split. Let $N$ be the number of observations in a sample. Let $a$ to be the number of observation pairs with the same labels and located in the same cluster, and let $b$ to be the number of observation pairs with different labels and located in different clusters. The Rand Index can be calculated using the following formula: $$\\text{RI} = \\frac{2(a + b)}{n(n-1)}.$$ \n",

The Rand Index (RI) evaluates the similarity of the two splits of the same sample. In order for this index to be close to zero for any clustering outcomes with any $n$ and number of clusters, it is essential to scale it, hence the Adjusted Rand Index: $$\\text{ARI} = \\frac{\\text{RI} - E[\\text{RI}]}{\\max(\\text{RI}) - E[\\text{RI}]}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This metric is symmetric and does not depend in the label permutation. Therefore, this index is a measure of distances between different sample splits. $\\text{ARI}$ takes on values in the $[-1, 1]$ range.

It is defined by the [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory) function and interprets a sample split as a discrete distribution (likelihood of assigning to a cluster is equal to the percent of objects in it). The $MI$ index is defined as the [mutual information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information) for two distributions, corresponding to the sample split into clusters. Intuitively, the mutual information measures the share of information common for both clustering splits i.e. how information about one of them decreases the uncertainty of the other one.\n",

    "Similarly to the $\\text{ARI}$, the $\\text{AMI}$ is defined. This allows us to get rid of the $MI$ index's increase with the number of clusters. The $\\text{AMI}$ lies in the $[0, 1]$ range. Values close to zero mean the splits are independent, and those close to 1 mean they are similar (with complete match at $\\text{AMI} = 1$).\n",

Both lie in the $[0, 1]$ range, and values closer to 1 indicate more accurate clustering results. These metrics' values are not scaled as the $\\text{ARI}$ or $\\text{AMI}$ metrics are and thus depend on the number of clusters. A random clustering result will not have metrics' values closer to zero when the number of clusters is big enough and the number of objects is small. In such a case, it would be more reasonable to use $\\text{ARI}$.

Let $a$ be the mean of the distance between an object and other objects within one cluster and $b$ be the mean distance from an object to objects from the nearest cluster (different from the one the object belongs to). Then the silhouette measure for this object is $$s = \\frac{b - a}{\\max(a, b)}.$$\n",

Therefore, the higher the silhouette value is, the better the results from clustering.\n",
