    "## 1. Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "From the picture below, it is intuitively clear that, in our credit scoring problem, *Age* is much more important than *Income*. This can be formally explained using the concept of *information gain*.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../img/credit_scoring_toy_tree_english.png\" align='center'>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of many decision trees or a random forest, the closer the mean position of a feature over all the trees to the root, the more significant it is for a given classification or regression problem. Gains in the splitting criterion, such as the *Gini impurity*, obtained at each optimal split in every tree is a measure of importance that is directly associated with the splitting feature. The value of this score is distinct for each feature and accumulates over all the trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go a little deeper into the details. \n",
    "\n",
    "There exist a lot of methods to assess feature importances. Leo Breinman in his works suggested to evaluate the importance of a variable by measuring decrease of accuracy of the forest when the variable is randomly permuted or decrease of impurity of a nodes where the given variable is used for splitting. The former method is often called **permutation importance**. The latter method is used in `sklearn`."

    "\n",
    "Inspired by [this](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5231126_Conditional_Variable_Importance_for_Random_Forests) article.\n",
    "The average reduction in accuracy caused by a variable is determined during the calculation of the out-of-bag error. The greater the reduction in accuracy due to an exclusion or permutation of the variable, the higher its *importance score*. For this reason, variables with a greater average reduction in accuracy are generally more significant for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rationale for calculating permutation importance is the following: By randomly permuting the predictor variable $X_j$, its original association with the response $Y$ is broken. When the permuted variable $X_j$, together with all the others non-permuted variables, is used the response for the out-of-bag observations, the prediction *accuracy* decreases substantially if the original $X_j$ was associated with response. Thus, as a measure of variable importance, the difference in prediction accuracy before and after permuting is used."

    "The picture above shows that, more often than not, customers pay great attention to staff and the price-quality ratio. This couple of factors affects the resulting overall rating the most. The difference between these two features and other features is not very large, so we can conclude that exclusion of any of these features will lead to a reduction of model's accuracy. However, based on our analysis, we can recommend hostel owners to focus primarily on staff training and price-to-quality ratio."
