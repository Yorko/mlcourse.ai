    "Furthermore, XGBoost is often the standard recipe for [winning](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/master/demo/README.md#usecases) [ML competitions](http://blog.kaggle.com/tag/xgboost/). It is so popular that the idea of stacking XGBoosts has become a meme. Moreover, boosting is an important component in [many recommender systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_to_rank#Practical_usage_by_search_engines); sometimes, it is even considered a [brand](https://yandex.com/company/technologies/matrixnet/).\n",

    "Boosting was born out of [the question:](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/papers/boostnote.pdf) is it possible to get one strong model from a large amount of relatively weak and simple models? By saying \"weak models\", we do not mean simple basic models like decision trees but models with poor accuracy performance, where poor is a little bit better than random.\n",
    "\n",
    "[A positive mathematical answer](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/papers/strengthofweak.pdf) to this question was identified, but it took a few years to develop fully functioning algorithms based on this solution e.g. AdaBoost. These algoritms take a greedy approach: first, they build a linear combination of simple models (basic algorithms) by re-weighing the input data. Then, the model (usually a decision tree) is built on earlier incorrectly predicted objects, which are now given larger weights.  \n",

    "The algorithm itself has a very clear visual interpretation and intuition for defining weights. Let's have a look at the following toy classification problem where we are going to split the data between the trees of depth 1 (also known as 'stumps') on each iteration of AdaBoost.

    "\n",
    "AdaBoost works well, but [the lack](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring07/cos424/papers/boosting-survey.pdf) of explanation for why the algorithm is successful sewed the seeds of doubt. Some considered it a super-algorithm, a silver bullet, but others were skeptical and believed AdaBoost was just overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "The overfitting problem did indeed exist, especially when data had strong outliers. Therefore, in those types of problems, AdaBoost was unstable. Fortunately, a few professors in the statistics department at Stanford, who had created Lasso, Elastic Net, and Random Forest, started researching the algorithm. In 1999, Jerome Friedman came up with the generalization of boosting algorithms development - Gradient Boosting (Machine), also known as GBM. With this work, Friedman set up the statistical foundation for many algorithms providing the general approach of boosting for optimization in the functional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "CART, bootstrap, and many other algorithms have originated from Stanford's statistics department. In doing so, the department has solidified their names in future textbooks. These algorithms are very practical, and some recent works have yet to be widely adopted. For example, check out [glinternet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.2719).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Not many video recordings of Friedman are available. Although, there is a very interesting [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hupHmBVvb0) with him about the creation of CART and how they solved statistics problems (which is similar to data analysis and data science today) more than 40 years ago.\n",

    "\n",
    "In general, there has been a transition from engineering and algorithmic research to a full-fledged approach to building and studying algorithms. From a mathematical perspective, this is not a big change - we are still adding (or boosting) weak algorithms and enlarging our ensemble with gradual improvements for parts of the data where the model was inaccurate. But, this time, the next simple model is not just built on re-weighted objects but improves its approximation of the gradient of overall objective function. This concept greatly opens up our algorithms for imagination and extensions.\n",

    "## History of GBM\n",
    "\n",
    "It took more than 10 years after the introduction of GBM for it to become an essential part of the data science toolbox.   \n",
    "GBM was extended to apply to different statistics problems: GLMboost and GAMboost for strengthening already existing GAM models, CoxBoost for survival curves, and RankBoost and LambdaMART for ranking.   \n",
    "Many realizations of GBM also appeared under different names and on different platforms: Stochastic GBM, GBDT (Gradient Boosted Decision Trees), GBRT (Gradient Boosted Regression Trees), MART (Multiple Additive Regression Trees), and more. In addition, the ML community was very segmented and dissociated, which made it hard to track just how widespread boosting had become.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, boosting had been actively used in search ranking. This problem was rewritten in terms of a loss function that penalizes errors in the output order, so it became convenient to simply insert it into GBM. AltaVista was one of the first companies who introduced boosting to ranking. Soon, the ideas spread to Yahoo, Yandex, Bing, etc. Once this happened, boosting became one of the main algorithms that was used not only in research but also in core technologies in industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='https://habrastorage.org/web/48a/ea4/fff/48aea4fffdbe4e5f9205ba81110e6061.jpg' align='right' width=30%> ML competitions, especially Kaggle, played a major role in boosting's popularization. Now, researchers had a common platform where they could compete in different data science problems with large number of participants from around the world. With Kaggle, one could test new algorithms on the real data, giving algoritms oppurtunity to \"shine\", and provide full information in sharing model performance results across competition data sets. This is exactly what happened to boosting when it was used at [Kaggle](http://blog.kaggle.com/2011/12/21/score-xavier-conort-on-coming-second-in-give-me-some-credit/) (check interviews with Kaggle winners starting from 2011 who mostly used boosting). The [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) library quickly gained popularity after its appearance. XGBoost is not a new, unique algorithm; it is just an extremely effective realization of classic GBM with additional heuristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm has gone through very typical path for ML algorithms today: mathematical problem and algorithmic crafts to successful practical applications and mass adoption years after its first appearance."

    "\n",
    "In lieu of this, a very simple instrument was invented (which is rarely remembered in practice): weighing observations and assigning weight functions. The simplest example of such weighting is the setting of weights for class balance. In general, if we know that some subset of data, both in the input variables $\\large x$ and in the target variable $\\large y$, has greater importance for our model, then we just assign them a larger weight $\\large w(x,y)$.

For example, the usage of weights proportional to $\\large |y|$ in $\\large L_1$ loss function is not equivalent to $\\large L_2$ loss because the gradient will not take into account the values of the predictions themselves: $\\large \\hat{f}(x)$.\n",
