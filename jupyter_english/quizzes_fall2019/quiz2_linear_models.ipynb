    "Whether math is needed in Data Science - that's a controversial question. Honestly, there's a ~95% chance that you'll never need to derive a math formula while predicting churn, credit fault, customer life-time value, looking for financial fraud or recommending TV shows or, in general, while improving your company's business via insights from data. I, personally, needed to take a derivative only once in a real project. \n",
